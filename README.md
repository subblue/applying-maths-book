# Applying Maths in the Chemical and Biomolecular Sciences
### By Godfrey Beddard

This is an updated and expanded version of the [print book from 2009](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Applying-Maths-Chemical-Biomolecular-Sciences/dp/0199230919).


## Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the Applying Maths Book book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `applying_maths_book/` directory
4. Run `jupyter-book clean applying_maths_book/` to remove any existing builds
5. Run `jupyter-book build applying_maths_book/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `applying_maths_book/_build/html/`.

### Credits

This project is created using the excellent open source [Jupyter Book project](https://jupyterbook.org/) and the [executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book template](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book).
