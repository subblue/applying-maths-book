    "\n",
    "The fourier transform can be extended to 2D and 3D. The 2D transform is important in image analysis, optics and 2D spectroscopies such as ultrafast infra-red and nmr analysis. The 3D transform is used to describe x-ray diffraction from crystals which is the definitive way of determining molecular structure and is of central importance in chemistry and biochemistry. We shall illustrate how x-ray diffraction leads to structure using 2D fourier transforms.\n",

    "The 2D forward and inverse transform is written down easily by analogy with the 1D versions, but rather than use $k_x,k_y$ for the conjugate variables it is clearer instead to use $u,v$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle g(u,v)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x,y)e^{-i(xu+yv)}dxdy$$\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle f(x,y)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(u,v)e^{+i(xu+yv)}dudv\\qquad\\tag{49}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and, clearly, if the function $f(x,y)$ can be written as the product $f(x)f(y)$, which means no terms such as $xy$ are present then the 2D transform is the product of 1D ones, which is a great simplification,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle g(u,v)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)e^{-ixu}dx\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(y)e^{-iyv}dy\\qquad\\tag{50}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetry properties of the function $f$ are important and show themselves clearly in the transform, which is most easily viewed as an image. If $f(x,y)$ is real, which it will be in an experiment, then $g(u,v)=g^{*}(-u,-v)$ and then $|g(u,v|^2$ is centrosymmetric, i.e. has a centre of inversion. If the function does not change after rotation about the origin by $(360/n)^\\text{o}$, i.e. is indistinguishable after $n$-fold rotation, then the transform behaves similarly. If $f$ is real and $n$ is odd then $|g(u,v|^2$ has $n$-fold symmetry but is also centrosymmetric so that $2n$-fold symmetry is apparent in the transform, i.e. $5$-fold symmetry appears as $10$-fold, see figure 63. Mirror planes behave similarly, $f(x,y)=\\pm f(-x,y)$ produce $g(-u,v)=\\pm g(u,v)$ and $|g(u,v|^2$ has mirror plane symmetry. Besides these symmetry properties the basic inverse relationship between a function and its transform still exists, but now in both $x$ and $y$, i.e. the further apart the features in the function are the closer they will be in the transform and *vice versa*.\n",

    "The first image below is that of two point sources and results in a cosine shaped image as the transform of two delta functions is a cosine. A cut through the image along the direction of the two points would produce a cosine, although the way the colour is presented in the image distorts ones perception of this. The four-fold image shows the same effect but now in two directions producing a transform of squares rather than lines. The blue part of the image has the greatest intensity, the red the least. The three-, five- and seven-fold points produce double the symmetry due to the transform being centrosymmetric. As a technical aside, when calculating the transforms the images have to be centralised before they have the appearance shown. Python/numpy has a function to do this. If the numpy library is called _np_ then the transform of a 2D array called _image_ is $\\mathtt{g2D = np.fft.fft2(image)}$ and to centralise the transform $\\mathtt{FTimage = np.fft.fftshift(g2D)}$. Plotting can be done using $\\mathtt{plt.imshow(FTimage)}$.\n",

In two dimensions the 'top hat' function in $x$ becomes a slit, of infinite length in the $y$ direction, or a rectangular hole if $y$ is of finite length.  Light passes through the slit will be diffracted, (Franhofer diffraction), and its intensity is described by the absolute value of the fourier transform. These transforms can be observed experimentally using a laser pointer or collimated light from a LED with masks cut with rectangular or circular apertures or as pinholes representing a molecule's atoms or even a lattice of pinholes. When the light is projected onto a screen the transform should be apparent. The size of the apertures relative to laser wavelength need to be considered to optimise the effects. The transform can also be calculated as illustrated below.\n",

If diffraction occurred through such an aperture the absolute value would be obtained because detectors (and our eyes) measure the intensity which is the square of the light's amplitude. The image would look similar except that all the function would be positive rather than both positive and negative. Notice the similarity of this to the transform of four points arranged in a square, fig 63, (ignoring the rotation of the latter). The difference in the transforms occurs because when more than one object is present a cosine along each symmetry axis is also present. This may be understood as the image of two or more delta functions convoluted with the shape of the object itself; when more than one object is transformed the transform spreads out over transform space.\n",

The transform for a ring is in terms of a Bessel function and for a disc is an Airy function, both of which are integrals that oscillate rather as the sinc function does. The transforms for one and two discs is shown, as their absolute value, in figure 65. These results are calculated using the numerical FFT. The diffraction pattern has the symmetry of the circle with ever increasing waves radiating outwards. The right-hand figure shows two discs separated by a small amount, here the transform looks like that of two points (a cosine) convoluted with a disc, i.e a cosine superimposed on expanding circles. The cosine rises and falls along the direction of centres of the two discs. The closer the two discs are the further apart the features in the transform due to the reciprocal nature of the variables in real space ($x,y$) and conjugate or transform space ($u,v$).\n",

In the grid of fig 68 there are numerous groups of four points and so the transform becomes more like a set of point functions just.

The key point is that it is the _intensity_ of each spot that provides the information about the structure of the original image, not the position of the spots in the transform, which gives only the spacing of the repeated pattern.

    "## 13.1 Diffraction of x-rays\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a molecule can be determined by detecting the x-rays diffracted by its crystal. The experiment consists of diffraction, detection and computational analysis which combined act as if a microscope was used. The explanation of how this works has two parts: (1) how is magnification achieved and (2) how does the measured data lead to the structure. The first part is quite straightforward, the second more involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Magnification**\n",
    "The magnification can be explained by reference to Huygens' wavelets as in figure 70a. A plane wave arrives at the bottom of the figure and is diffracted by two slits shown as red dots, alternatively these represent sources in their own right, for example two atoms whose electrons re-radiate x-rays. By calculating where the circular wavelets overlap the position of the bright fringes on a detector can be predicted. To be accurate this has to be done in the 'far field', i.e. at a very great distance from the source of diffraction. Alternatively, by assuming that the path lengths are different by integer numbers of wavelengths produces $n\\lambda = d \\sin(\\theta)$  where $d$ is the separation of the sources, $\\lambda$ the wavelength and the integers are $n=0,\\pm 1,\\pm 2\\cdots $. The angle $\\theta$ can be obtained from the experiment, as shown in the figure where $\\tan(\\theta)=(d/2+x)/R$ and $x,R$ are measurements. These values are generally many centimetres where as $d,\\lambda $ are millions of times smaller. This is made clearer when the angle $\\theta$ is small, then $\\tan(\\theta)\\approx \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta $ making $\\displaystyle \\frac{x}{R} =\\frac{n\\lambda}{d}$ and as these are ratios the orders of magnitude difference in size cancel out and once $\\lambda$ is known so is $d$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The deflection caused by diffraction is crucial here for this separates the diffracted beam from the initial one allowing it to be detected against a dark (zero) background and secondly the fact that the angle of detection depends on the separation $d$ means that many distances can be separately measured without overlapping one another. The ratio of distances automatically enables magnification once the beams have propagated far enough to allow accurate measurement of diffracted spot positions.\n",

    "Fig. 70a. Huygens wavelets to explain magnification after x-ray diffraction.

The sketch on the right shows the calculation to determine the angle $\\theta$ from measurements of $x$ and $R$.\n",
    "__________\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Structure**\n",
    "Before we can find the cell dimensions it is necessary to understand how the x-rays are diffracted off the repeated and regular structure of the crystal. Diffraction of x-rays occurs by interaction of the electrons with the x-rays which then re-radiate in all directions. Only those directions satisfying conservation of momentum produce a diffracted beam that can be recorded as a bright spot on a detector. This means the only waves detected are those whose path-length differs by an integer number of wavelengths and therefore add constructively and re-enforce one another, all other waves cancel to zero. The condition for diffraction is given most generally by the Laue equation or equivalently and more simply by the Bragg condition, fig. 70, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle n\\lambda =2d\\sin(\\theta)\\qquad\\tag{54}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d$ is the _perpendicular_ spacing between similar planes of atoms and $\\theta$ is the angle the incoming x-ray makes to the plane of atoms. The diffracted beam is also at $\\theta$ to the plane so the diffracted angle is $2\\theta$ from the incoming beam. The diffraction order is $n$ and $\\lambda$ the x-ray wavelength, for example 0.1542 nm for Cu$K_{1\\alpha}$ or $0.178892$ nm for Co$K_{1\\alpha}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are different orders of diffraction $n = 0,\\pm 1,\\pm 2 \\cdots$ the third order reflexion from $(100)$ planes, for example, can be looked at in this way or it could be a first order reflexion from the set of planes $(300)$ with $1/3$ of the spacing of the $(100)$ planes. Consequently we can divide by the common factor $3$, i.e., \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle 3\\lambda = 2 d_{100}\\sin(\\theta_{300}) \\\\ \\lambda =2d_{300}\\sin(\\theta_{300}) $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "and this latter form of the equation is usually chosen by crystallographers so that $n$ does not appear in the Bragg equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the x-rays are diffracted it is usual to speak of them being 'reflected' from the planes of atoms because of the similarity of the geometry to that of reflection by light. Often the archaic spelling 'reflexion' is used and we use this also as a reminder that diffraction occurs. Figure 70 shows (images A and B) the Bragg arrangement for scattering off planes containing atoms. The path-length of the diffracted rays must be integer multiples of one another and this is only achieved at a fixed $d_{hkl}$ at a certain angle $\\theta$. Figures (C) and (D) show the scattering from different planes on the same lattice. Notice how the lattice has to be rotated to effect the Bragg condition for different $h,k,l$ because $\\lambda$ is constant and has a fixed direction in any experiment. To satisfy the Bragg condition when $d_{hkl}$ is small $\\theta$, the diffracted angle, has to be large and *vice versa*. As the crystal is rotated only at certain $\\theta$, and hence at some $hkl$, will diffraction occur, otherwise x-rays will pass through without being diffracted. The result is an image of diffracted x-ray that contains relatively few spots, even if this number is many thousands. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear from fig 70 and 71 that at large $h,k,l,\\;d_{hkl}$ is small and the diffracted angle $\\theta$ is large. Using a tetragonal crystal as an example, the larger the Miller indices ($hkl$) become the smaller the separation of the planes since \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle d_{hkl}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{h^2/a^2+k^2/b^2+l^2/c^2}}\\qquad \\text{tetragonal crystal  } a=b \\neq c \\text{, all angles } 90^\\text{o}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a=b\\ne c$ give the length of the unit cell's sides. The smaller the values of $d_{hkl}$ or the larger the $(hkl)$ the more detail the diffracted image of the crystal contains. In other words, as is expected for the conjugate relationship between fourier variables, small separation of lattice planes means spots at large distance from the origin in the diffracted image. This means that for fine resolution of a molecular structure accurate measurement of points at the periphery of an image is vitally important. \n",

    "The transform of several images has been described but these only become properly interesting when considered in the context of x-ray diffraction from crystals. The nature of x-ray diffraction is discussed shortly as is the connection between the crystal structure, the experimentally measured fourier transform and the fourier _synthesis_ of the structure. To do this we shall have to understand the scattering of x-rays by the electrons in the planes of atoms that exist in a (perfect) crystal because of the repetitive nature of each atom's position. The approach so far has been to start off with a lattice of points as in fig 68, or 69 and form the diffraction pattern, which is the fourier transform, but in an experiment things are the other way round, the data is the diffraction pattern and we want to know each atom's position. The use of fast computers and new algorithms nowadays make most of the analysis automatic, nevertheless the fundamentals must be understood otherwise how would one know if the results of automatic analysis make sense? \n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental data available is the position and intensity of the spots on the diffraction image. Because all detectors measure the intensity of the x-ray, which is its amplitude squared, and not its amplitude which is proportional to the electron density of an atom, the image cannot be directly transformed back into a structure. However, there is also an excess of information, for example, a molecule consisting of $10$ atoms needs $30$ values to determine its coordinates but there may be $n=1000$ or so reflexions recorded so that there will be many redundant observations which can also be used. The problem is therefore given the intensities, how can we work backwards and determine the atomic coordinates? Bragg proposed a method, which is to let the intensities be found by a fourier *series*, this process is called fourier *synthesis* (section 1.1) rather than the fourier _analysis_ described in section 6.

The structure factors $F_{hkl}$ are functions of the unit cell dimensions $a,b,c$, the atom's position e.g. $x_j,y_j,z_j$ for atom $j$ at each reflection plane $h,k,l$ whereas in eqn. 53 the $x,y,z$ are any coordinates in the unit cell used locate the electron density. Normally the unit cell $x/a,y/b,z/c$ would be split in to a grid of, say, 25 points in each direction.  \n",

In theory an infinite number of structure factors $F_{hkl}$ are necessary in eqn. 53, but naturally we only have a finite number of diffraction spots and so some error is introduced into each atom's position, but these are not too serious in x-ray diffraction because there is a fall-off in scattering intensity with Bragg angle $\\theta$ so that the structure factors get smaller as this angle increases.

No one has yet discovered how to measure the x-ray amplitude instead of the intensity and so a fourier synthesis has to be used, i.e. constructing the electron density by choosing, by non-linear, least-squares or other methods, various $F_{hkl}$ until the data is fitted. This sounds quite simple but as we shall see the overall sign and magnitude of the calculated $F$ depends on each atom's position in the unit cell.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The convention in describing crystals is that a _crystal structure_ consists of atoms, a _crystal lattice_ consists of points, and a _crystal system_ consists of axes usually described by vectors. In a crystal the _unit cell_ represents a repeated structure containing the atoms positions and is described by vectors $\\bar a,\\bar b, \\bar c$, which need not be at right angles to one another. The unit cell is normally taken to have the minimum size needed to describe the repeating nature of the atoms. If a point in the unit cell is chosen to be the origin, a corner for example, this single position, when repeated over and over in the crystal, forms a lattice of points as in Fig 68. This lattice will belong to one of the $7$ crystal systems and $14$ Bravais lattices. The origin does not have to be the position of an atom but often is. The other atoms then form a similar lattice but displaced in a manner described by the atom's position relative to the origin, this is equivalent to imagining that the whole unit cell is replicated again and again to form the crystal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D lattice based on the atom at the origin is then imagined to be divided into stacks of similar planes of atoms all in the same position relative in their unit cell, see fig 72. These planes (shown edge-on as lines in fig 72) are given indices ($h k l$) which are called Miller Indices where $h,k,l$ are positive or negative integers including zero. Although there are numerous parallel planes we refer to them collectively using only their unique $h,k,l$ values such as ($3\\;14\\;\\bar 1$), where the bar indicates a negative direction.  Via the Bragg diffraction equation (eqn. D4) each set of planes, and thus each $hkl$, produce one bright spot on the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work out the Miller indices for any set of planes start by moving along the unit cell in the $\\bar a$ direction and count how many pieces $a$ is divided into by the planes, i.e. the number of spaces crossed, then repeat this for sides $b$ and $c$, the integers produced are the Miller indices.\n",

    "The unit cell dimensions can often be found using power diffraction, and you will probably have done such an experiment in a practical course. In this method the crystals are crushed and placed into a narrow glass capillary tube which is placed in the centre of the instrument. The detector moves in an arc round the sample and the diffracted x-ray  are recorded as a function of the angle. This arrangement is called a Debye - Scherrer camera. In the past the detector was a strip of photographic film that was darkened by the x-rays and older textbook show the images produced as arcs on this paper. Nowadays a particle counting or imaging detector is used but in either case a plot of angle vs. intensity is produced. The crystals are at random angles (in $\\theta$ and $\\phi$) but by Bragg's law the diffraction can occur only at certain $\\theta$ angles of the planes of atoms to the x-ray beam (see fig72(A) but those planes can be anywhere around the x-ray beam at an angle $\\phi$, i.e. there is cylindrical symmetry. Different $hkl$ planes diffract at different angles and so several cones are produced, see fig 73. As there are numerous crystals, all angles $\\phi$ around the x-ray beam direction (at a given $2\\theta$ ) will diffract and so the all cones will have many photons.

    "As the x-rays scatter off the electrons in an atom, clearly the more electrons there are the greater the scattering will be. Thus we expect, and observe, that heavy atoms produce much more intense bright spots on a detector than do lighter atoms. However, atoms are not point objects but have a real size with an electron 'cloud' radius that is only a little smaller than a bond length. Electron density is greater towards the atom's centre and less towards the perimeter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a largely spherical electron distribution, when x-rays are scattered and detected at an angle away from incoming the x-ray's direction, there will be a path-length difference between one side of the atom and the other and this leads to scattered waves becoming out of phase, and hence of reduced intensity and increasingly so as the scattering angle increases. As the atoms in a molecule are always close to one another, so are electrons on different atoms and this proximity potentially leads to a great computational complication. However, this is easily overcome by assuming that atoms are point objects and using a function, the *atomic scattering factor*, on each atom to allow for the scattering from its different parts. The atomic scattering factor is a decaying function of the scattering angle. At zero angle it is the atomic number $Z$ (plus or minus the number of charges for ions) and decreases to a constant value in terms of $\\sin(\\theta)\\lambda=1/(2d_{hkl})$.  The scattering factor can be accurately calculated using quantum chemistry methods, Hartree-Fock for example, and in some cases measured, and are known accurately.

Furthermore, relatively few waves are needed as shown in fig. 78. The left panel shows, at the top, the three molecules positioned face-on and the right-hand panel positioned edge-on, the summed wave is shown immediately below (brown) and the individual waves are numbered with their frequency.

Pairs of oxygen atoms are in the same relative symmetry, $1 : 3$ and $2 : 4$ so only the phase of O$_2$ and O$_3$ need be calculated.  Oxygen 2 is at $y/b=0.8025$ so the structure factor is $F^O_{d_{200}}\\cos( 2\\pi h 0.8025)= -4.76$ where $k=l=0$ and $x/a=0.8025$. The same value is found for all the oxygen atoms making the total structure factor $F_{d_{200}}= 13$ and the intensity $169$.\n",

    "The (110) reflection is strong, fig. 83. All the Ti atoms are in the (110) plane and so their phase is $0$ or $2\\pi$ thus the cosine is unity and the amplitude of each is $f^{Ti}_{d_{110}}=16.95$ where $1/2d_{110}= 0.152$. Oxygens $1$ and $2$ are also in the plane and their phase is similarly $2\\pi$ thus each amplitude is $f^O_{d_{110}}=6.96$. The other oxygens are at fractional distances of $d_{110}$. Oxygen 3 is at a distance $D_{O3}=2.003$ which is a phase angle of $2\\pi 2.003/4.65\\equiv 219^\\text{o}$ with amplitude $f^O_{d_{110}}\\cos(2\\pi 0.43)=-5.39$. The fourth oxygen also has a phase angle of $-219^\\text{o}$ but adds towards the total because $\\cos(-\\theta)=\\cos(\\theta)$. From all 6 atoms in the unit cell the total structure factor is $F_{110}=37$ so the intensity is $1369$ and should be seen as an intensely bright spot.\n",

    "Having obtained structure factors we can attempt to find the position of the atoms. All that has to be done is to use eqns D3 with D5. Of course we already know the answer but let us check that we can reproduce the positions of the atoms of fig 81 for example, and by looking down the $c$ axis calculate the projection of the structure onto the $a-b$ plane.  Figure 84 shows the result where the centroid of the contours are in the same relative positions as the original, fig 81. The most intense features arise from the Ti atoms as they contain most electrons. This figure was calculated by dividing the unit cell into a $40 \\times 40\\times 40$ grid and summing along the $c$ axis. Only $hkl$ values from $-5 \\to +5$ were used showing that a reasonable reproduction of the structure is possible using a relatively limited range of. Using a larger range of $hkl$ reduces the spot sizes as smaller $d_{hkl}$ are used and so the resolution increases.\n",

The $R$ factor between the two structures, fig. 85, is $0.26$ showing that the agreement between them is poor as is clear from the images of the projections. The bond lengths Ti to oxygen 1 (or 2) is only changed by 0.023 nm in a bond length of 0.20 nm and this shows how sensitive x-ray diffraction is to small changes in geometry. The bond length Ti to oxygen 3 (or 4) is similar to that for the other two oxygens and is $0.196$ nm but looks less because of the projection down the $c$ axis.\n"

    "## 13.10 X ray Diffraction from DNA\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 85a is a copy of the original figure from Rosalind Frankin and R. Gosling's 1953 paper (Nature, v.171, p.740, 1953) which showed for the first time the x-ray diffraction pattern from para-crystalline, calf thymus B-DNA fibres. In the same issue is the famous paper by Watson and Crick (Nature v.171, p.737, 1953) in which they speculate, with a sketch of the same, that the DNA is a double helix with base pairs inside the helices and the phosphates on the outside. They comment 'we have been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins and Dr. R. E. Franklin' which brings us back to figure 85a. Three quarters of a century later, the quality of this image looks poor but recall that this was recorded on photographic plates and that transistors, and thus integrated circuits, had not been invented and neither had electronic detectors, such as ccd's, and computers were all but unknown. The fact that sensitivity was low by modern standards means that the only spots ('blobs') detected come from atoms with the most electrons which are the phosphorous atoms, or possibly the phosphate group, and knowing this greatly helps identification.  Naturally far better x-ray data was soon available but it is very interesting to see how the limited original data lead to a correct understanding of the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image contains a great deal of information that is accessible without any detailed calculation. The X or cross shape on the overall image is clear as are the split horizontal lines. The generally broad size of each 'blob' is due to the fact that the sample was para-crystalline, i.e. it was pulled out of a viscous aqueous solution of the sodium salt. The DNA filaments are kept apart by the water and counterions (Na$^+$) and in this state the DNA is kept more or less parallel along the fibre pulling direction but randomly distributed otherwise, probably rather like a nematic liquid crystal. This disorder also means that the spot sizes ('blobs' or 'smears') are large.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross or x-shape indicated that the structure is a helix such as produced from a straight linear polymer. The structure factor for helices producing this unique signature has previously been worked out by Cochran et al. (1952), so that it must have been obvious on seeing the x-ray image that a helix was present. This form of an image is only observed because the x-ray is at right angles to the fibre pulling direction, and so the DNA helices are seen side on. Had this not been the case and the DNA's were aligned in the same direction as the x-ray (sideways to pulling direction) then an image similar to that of fig 63 (bottom row) would have been formed but with twenty fold symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal lines, called 'layer lines', labelled in fig 85a from $0$ to $\\pm 10$, are the result of the helix not being continuous but due to phosphate groups in parallel layers along the twist of the helix. Just as in fig. 65 where two spheres cause the image to be split with fringes, so in the DNA the vertical splitting of the x-ray image (the 'layer lines') is due to interference between the helical twist of the phosphates' positions and the planes containing individual pairs of phosphate groups. The structure is shown on the right of fig 85a where the circles represent the phosphates; the red and blue lines are only to guide the eye. Although it is not very clear from the x-ray image this does repeat after $10$ layer lines are encountered. This is shown as the approximately diamond shape from the two dark regions top and bottom and the fuzzy, but clear, features on the left and right with maxima at the zero'th layer line. This shows that there are $10$ phosphates in a period and from the dimensions of the image the period is $3.4$ nm with each base pair separated by $0.34$ nm and the helix thus has a twist of $36^\\text{o}$. Note how the period in the helix and in the x-ray image are in a reciprocal relationship as are conjugate variables in any fourier transform.  The position of the maximum intensity of a layer line, i.e. the angle it makes to the vertical is used to calculate the radius of the helix, which turns out to be almost exactly $1$ nm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image shows that the 4th layer line is missing, this is a crucial observation and can only be explained by there being two similar helices separated by 3/8 of a period. The interference of these two helices produces a very precise pattern. Different periods, for example, produce different patterns of missing and weak and strong layer lines. A more detailed analysis has been given by  Lucas et al. (1999), Crouse (2007) and Thompson et al. (2018).\n",

The radius of the helix is $1$ nm. The vertical line on the right hand diagram shows the centre of the helix. The circles the phosphate groups, the dashed lines the position of the base pairs. The red and blue helices  are just to guide the eye. Note the reciprocal relationship between the dimensions on the image and on the structure. The two helices are displaced by $3p/8$ and this is determined by the absence of the $4^{th}$ layer line.\n",

    "The pattern of the layer lines can be understood from basic wave theory, an example is given in Chapter 1, section 5.5 or by using figure 85b below. When the phase between the two helices differs (A and B) by $(3/8)2\\pi n \\equiv 3n\\lambda /8$ only the fourth order line has zero intensity, because the waves are out of phase by $3\\lambda/2$ and so exactly cancel one another. Cancellation can happen with other phases but then other layer lines do not fit the experimental data, for example $1/8$ predicts a more intense first than second layer line which is not observed.\n",

    "As a test the x-ray image can be simulated by positioning the phosphate groups in helices as shown on the right of fig. 85a, and for simplicity in two dimensions, and then fourier transforming this image. This of course is a considerable approximation but if the diffraction pattern is calculated at small angles the approximation is fairly good. A bigger approximation is that only a single molecule is included, whereas in the experiment many tens of thousands will diffract the x-rays. If a second or third structure is added to our simulation then each of the 'blobs' is divided by fringes, just as in figures 65 to 69. The fact that the simulation and data are similar means that in the experiment disorder in position and angular arrangement is making the many separate spots that would be present in a perfect crystal merge into blobs.\n",

Note that layer line $4$ is missing and layer line 1 is less intense than line 2. \n",
