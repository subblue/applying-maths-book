    "Equations of the form $\\varphi(D)y = b \\sin(mx)$ and $\\varphi(D)y = b\\cos(mx)$ often describe forces and simple harmonic motion where the driving force is a sine or cosine. To solve this type of equation, use the exponential from $\\displaystyle e^{imx}$ etc. to replace the sine or cosine term. The real part is then extracted if $f(x)$ is a cosine, and the imaginary part if a sine, because $\\displaystyle e^{\\pm iax} = \\cos(ax) \\pm i\\sin(ax)$. This method is therefore effectively the same as the previous section.\n",

If the function $G(x) = 1$, then the $f(x)$ reverts to a pure exponential. The formula (32) allows a solution in cases where $\\varphi(m) = 0$.\n",

    "The equation $(D^2 + D - 2)y = 2\\sinh(2x)$ has the complementary function $\\displaystyle y_h = Ae^{−2x} + Be^{x}$. The sinh is now expanded into exponentials making the particular integral\n",

    "Using the method from the previous section, the first term is $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{(D-1)(D+2)}e^{2x}=\\frac{e^{2x}}{4}$. The second exponential term is $\\displaystyle \\frac{-1}{(D-1)(D+2)}e^{-2x}=-\\frac{e^{2x}}{0}$, which cannot be solved in this way as $\\varphi (m) = 0$. Instead, the solution is found in two steps; the first step in the usual way, substituting into $D − 1$, and the second using equation (32). The first step is,\n",

    "\n",
    "The equations we have been solving are of the type found when oscillators have, in addition to acceleration, a damping term due to viscous effects, and another term if an external force drives the oscillator. The effect of damping is to dissipate the energy from the moving body into the surrounding medium where it ends up as heat. Consequently, if an external force does not drive the body, the damping eventually brings the body to rest. In the presence of a constant force such as gravity the damping due to air resistance will cause a falling object to reach a constant terminal velocity. On the molecular scale, a charged protein moving in the presence of an external electric field will be accelerated and driven along by the field but this motion will be constrained by the viscous drag effects due to interaction with the solvent. The equations used to describe the motion of bodies in fluids can be 'mapped' onto those describing electronic circuits consisting of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the oscillator is not driven but is in a viscous medium, a pendulum in air for example, the equation of motion is modified from that given in Section 3.2, and the motion is described as exhibiting *free damped oscillations*. The damping naturally resists motion, and it is often assumed to be linearly proportional to the speed. The force it produces is $-cdx/dt$ where $c$ is a constant of proportionality and is the damping coefficient and has units kg s$^{-1}$. The negative sign in front of $c$ ensures that damping resists motion.\n",

The ratio $t/T$ is the number of periods for the oscillator to lose 1/$e$ of its amplitude. If the oscillator is lightly damped, then the $Q$ is large and _vice versa_. The idea of $Q$ factors is, however, more important in the driven damped oscillator; the closer the driven frequency is to the free or natural oscillator frequency, the greater the $Q$ factor is. The (under) damped oscillator in Fig. 12 has a $Q$ of $\\approx 3$, because $t/T \\approx 1$, and this $Q$ is very small; it is clear that very few oscillations occur before the motion effectively ceases.\n",

The characteristic behaviour of an oscillator with a high $Q$ factor (low damping) is that it responds by peaking with large displacements near to resonance, and is relatively unperturbed by other driving frequencies.

    "\n",
    "Although the damped, forced oscillator is described in terms of a mechanical oscillator, such as a pendulum or a spring, it also forms a classical model of how an atom or molecule interacts non-resonantly with a light wave. The electric field of the radiation produces a sinusoidal force on each electron. The displacement of the electron $\\delta x$ produces a dipole moment $e\\delta x$ if $e$ is the electronic charge. The polarization or dipole moment/unit volume is obtained from this model by summing over all the electrons in a given volume. The refractive index and conductivity can be derived from the polarization. However, the classical model of absorbing a photon leads to very unusual behaviour because energy would be absorbed over a wide range of frequencies and in increasing amounts as resonance is approached, which is clearly not what is observed experimentally. Only a quantum model properly describes absorption.\n",

    "### **(iii) Q-switching lasers**\n",
    "Q-switching is used to produce intense nanosecond duration laser pulses, which have diverse uses such as to measure rates of chemical reactions, cutting and welding materials and in laser ranging or 'lidar'. Siegman (1986) describes Q-switching in detail but the basic idea is as follows. The gain material is excited by flash lamps or laser diodes but the laser cavity is initially held in a condition of low gain, so it cannot lase even though the gain medium, such as Nd$^{3+}$ ions in YAG, is being excited. The gain is forced to be low by an electro-optic polarizer inserted inside the laser cavity. This is aligned so that those photons that reach the cavity mirrors are not fed back into the gain medium with the correct polarization and are therefore not amplified. As the gain material is continuously being excited, a large population inversion soon results and consequently it contains a large amount of stored energy. A laser pulse is now made by suddenly increasing the $Q$ of the laser cavity by increasing the gain. This can be done by switching the state of the electro-optic polarizer so that light can now travel back and forth between the mirrors. The effect that this has is to cause a very rapid rise in the gain of the cavity because, by stimulated emission, the stored energy is converted into photons, and a laser pulse of a few nanoseconds duration is produced. The photons deplete the gain far more rapidly than it can be replenished by excitation from the flash lamps, and the gain drops, terminating the laser pulse. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $Q$ of an optical cavity is given by $Q = \\omega E/(-dE/dt)$, where $\\omega$ is the laser frequency, $E$ the energy, and $dE/dt$ the power or rate of change of energy. The Nd YAG laser operates at $1064$ nm and can typically produce a $1$ J, 10 ns duration $Q$-switched laser pulse. If the cavity gain is switched in $10$ ns, then the $Q$ of the cavity is, for a short period, extremely high at $\\approx$ $3$ million.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(iv) Atomic Force Microscope**\n",
    "The $Q$ of mechanical systems is also important. The scanning atomic force microscope, AFM, has a microscopic cantilever with an even smaller tip at its base. The first type of instruments worked in contact mode where the tip was dragged over a surface using piezoelectric actuators to control its position. The distance from the surface was measured by how much the cantilever was bent by the surface forces. In this mode, the surface can be damaged by the tip. To prevent this and to increase the quality of the images, the tip can be made to oscillate up and down when driven by a piezoelectric crystal and it only 'taps' the surface once per period. The electrons in an atom on the surface interact with the tip as it approaches and it does not have to touch a molecule for its presence to be felt. The oscillation's amplitude ($ \\approx 20$ nm) is maintained by a feedback loop and, as it approaches a molecule on the surface, the oscillation frequency changes and so the feedback changes also thus providing a measure of the surface shape. If the $Q$ of the cantilever is high, then the amplitude of the cantilever's response is large when the driving frequency is close to that of its natural frequency and is small at other frequencies. When a molecule is encountered, the force on the cantilever changes its frequency by a small amount, which because the $Q$ is high, causes a large change in its amplitude; see Fig. 14 thus increasing sensitivity. The $Q$ of the cantilever can be as high as $20000$ when operated at $250$ kHz and images with resolution of a few angstrom are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $Q$ factor can be redefined as the ratio of the resonant frequency to the full width at half maximum of the curve of power absorbed vs driving frequency or $Q = \\omega/\\Delta\\omega$.

    "## 12.13 Brownian motion\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1828, the naturalist Robert Brown (Brown, 1828) reported that the motion of pollen seen under the microscope never ceases. The same was soon shown to be true of microscopic particles of glass, minerals, petrified wood, and even stone from the Egyptian Sphinx. Various causes were investigated; convection currents, uneven evaporation, capillary action, and so forth, but none proved to be responsible. We now understand that Brownian motion is due to the ceaseless, thermally induced motion of all molecules colliding with one another and with larger particles and in doing so moving them. Because the number of collisions with a particle is not the same in all directions at each instant in time, the forces will not always cancel exactly and the particle will be knocked about in a random manner. Figure 14a shows a simulation of a random walk in two dimensions. In 1910, Perrin observed and recorded the random motion of a single particle under the microscope and measured the average of the square of the distance moved $\\langle x^2\\rangle$ in periods of $30$ seconds, the scale being of a few tens of micrometres. Einstein had previously calculated what the average displacement should be in a given time period. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total energy of a macroscopic particle in a liquid or gas is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy. Its average energy can be found by statistical mechanics and is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\big\\langle\\frac{ mv_x^2}{2} \\big\\rangle = k_BT/2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equipartition theorem states that each squared term in the equation for the displacement of a particle contributes $k_BT/2$ to the average energy. In three dimensions the average is therefore $3k_BT/2$. A particle moving in a harmonic potential has a contribution of $k_BT/2$ from its kinetic energy and $k_BT/2$ from its potential energy, since this energy is $kx^2/2$ for a displacement $x$ and force constant $k$. The total average energy is therefore $k_BT$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find an expression for $\\langle x^2\\rangle$, an equation of motion has to be solved, and for the driven and damped motion of a particle in a fluid, this equation has the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle  m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\\gamma\\frac{dx}{dt}=f(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma$ is a damping coefficient and $f$ is a fluctuating random force. However, this equation cannot be usefully solved because $f$ is a random quantity, but, in any case, the experimental measurement is the average of the square of the displacement $\\displaystyle \\langle x^2\\rangle$, not $x$ the displacement from equilibrium, so this average quantity is sought. There are two steps to doing this. First, a differential equation for $\\displaystyle x^2$ is sought and, secondly, its average over time is found and the equipartition theorem is used to do this. Although the averaging can be done before integrating, as this greatly simplifies the calculation, it is not essential because integration is a sum and the order of integrating and averaging can be interchanged. In physical terms, averaging before integrating is valid because we can repeatedly observe the displacement of one particle at each of several time steps and average the results, or we can observe many particles simultaneously, averaging after each time step. The ergodic hypothesis states that these approaches are equivalent.\n",

    "This equation has proved very successful in predicting the diffusional properties of molecules and properties depending on diffusion, such as the rate constants of diffusion controlled chemical reactions, even though the equations strictly relate only to macroscopic particles. As a rule of thumb, we can feel confident in using the equation if the solvent is smaller than the molecule diffusing in it, because the derivation assumes a continuous structureless solvent, and not a molecular one. When you use these equations, note that the SI unit of viscosity is Pa s ($\\mathrm{kg\\, m^{-1} s^{-1}}$) but the common unit is centipoise and $1$ Pa s = $10^{-3}$ cP. The diffusion coefficient $D$ has units of $\\mathrm{m^2\\, s^{-1}}$.\n"
