    "## SI units and prefixes\n",
    "\n",
    "The International System of Units (SI) is nowadays used in all textbooks and much of the scientific literature. See Mills et al. (1993) or Cohen et al. (2007) for a full description of all units. The SI system is based on a set of defined units so that a quantity either has one of these units, or is derived from them. There is also a set of named prefixes for numerical values and these are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SI Defined units\n",
    "\n",
    "The defined units are the metre (m), the kilogram (kg), the second (s), the kelvin, the unit of thermodynamics temperature (K), the ampere (A), the mole (mol), and the candela, which is luminous intensity (cd).\n",
    "\n",
    "## SI Derived units\n",
    "\n",
    "All other units we use, such as the joule, are derived from these base units. The joule (J) measures energy and $1 \\,J = 1 \\mathrm{\\,kg\\, m^2 \\,s^{-2} }$. The SI unit for force, the newton (N) is derived from SI base units using the relationship:\n",

    "\n",
    "A measurement always has two parts: a numerical value and its associated units. It is essential to report numbers to the appropriate number of decimal places. This is done either according to what is possible from the experimental conditions, or from the precision of numbers used in a calculation; and therefore some adjustment, called rounding, of the number is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single or perfect way of representing a number and so there is room for some personal preference, but scientific notation offers the least ambiguity. To represent a number in this notation, write it with one leading digit followed by the decimal point and then more digits followed by a power of $10$; for instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle 97453.1 \\to 9.74531 \\cdot 10^4,\\qquad 0.0245 \\to 2.45 \\cdot 10^{-2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the leading zeros in the second number are seen not to be significant. If a series of numbers are to be compared, then it is best to use the same power of $10$ for each; for example, the following three numbers shows how the steady increase in value can easily be recognized. It is even clearer when these numbers are rounded up, say to the nearest 1000, and this gives the values shown on the right.\n",

    "By the nature of any experiment, a measurement is only known to a certain number of significant digits. These are independent of the size of the number. For instance, $123.4$ and $0.00001234$, both contain four significant figures and these numbers can be written as $1.234 \\cdot 10^2$ and $1.234 \\cdot 10^{-5}$ respectively. The number $123.40$ contains five significant figures, because writing the last zero implies that this digit is known. The limited number of significant figures occurs because of many unknown variations in the way a quantity is measured. Imprecision may occur due to a sloppy experimental technique, but supposing that this is not the case, 'noise' may be added to a measurement from any number of sources. By 'noise' is meant the random variability that is seen in any measurement that you would prefer is not there and which often masks the true signal. Perhaps this noise is due to interference from other instruments in the laboratory, from mains voltage fluctuations, or from temperature variations. Noise could be present because measurements were at the limit of your instrument's capability. Often data is subsequently analysed to extract the information it contains; the slope of a line, for example, and then the number of significant figures reported as the slope and its uncertainty must be carefully considered. A calculator or computer will happily produce ten or more digits in an answer; almost invariably far more than is realistic. First, to decide how many significant figures there really are, the original data must be looked at before reaching a conclusion. The result can then be rounded to the correct number of significant figures at the very end of any calculation. Both the result and its associated error will need to be rounded, and this is done with a set of rules.\n",

    "## Experimental results with experimental uncertainties or errors\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only a few instances is chemistry where a value you are trying to measure or calculate is an integer, for example a quantum number or the number of atoms in a unit cell of a crystal but in most cases the result will be a real number. The number of significant figures quoted indicates how precise you consider the number to be. As an example a mass of $2.3457$ g measured on an analytical balance must be assumed to be somewhere in the range $2.34565 \\to 2.34575$, i.e an _absolute error bound_ of $0.00005$ g which is half the last significant figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The _relative error bound_ is the absolute bound divided by the value itself, $0.00005/2.3457 = 2.1315\\cdot 10^{-5}$ or $0.0000213$ but the error bound is $0.00005$ so this answer is only significant as far as the $5^{\\mathrm{th}}$ decimal place or $0.00002$ so is reported as $2\\cdot 10^{-5}$.  The _percentage error_ is $100$ times the relative bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error quoted with a measured mean value represents the chance that the data will fall between the error values quoted, usually this is approximately $68$%, meaning that by random chance $32$% of the times a measurement is made, a value outside the range will be observed. In some cases a $95$% limit may be used; this will depend on how the standard deviation or the standard error is defined and this is explained in more detail in Chapter 13. We shall suppose that this has been decided upon, so that just the numbers are examined. To report a result as $7.56 \\pm 0.03456$ kJ/mole would be wrong. It is reasonable to assume that the result is the mean value of several measurements because an error is given. The mean is quoted to only three significant figures, one part in a thousand, or two decimal places, and as the error is usually calculated from the data, it cannot be known to more figures than this. The result should be reported as $7.56 \\pm 0.03$ kJ/mole as the $3$ in the quoted error falls in the same decimal place as the $6$ in the number. If you want to be cautious, then $7.56 \\pm 0.04$ would be acceptable as would $7.56 \\pm 0.03_4$ to indicate the figure that could be rounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, experimental uncertainties (errors) should be rounded to one significant figure, unless the measurement is very precise, then two figures may be used. The error would normally always be rounded up. Once the uncertainty in the measurement is determined, the significant figures in the measured value may need to be revised. This would be the case if the error were determined by some means other than from analysing the data. Reporting  $\\Delta G = -6051.78 \\pm 30$ J/mole is just not reasonable as the error is so large; the result should be $\\Delta G = -6050\\pm 30 $ J/mole, as an uncertainty of $30$ means that the result could be as small as $6020$ or as large as $6080$, so that the trailing digits, $1, 7, 8$ do not matter; see figure 26.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second rule of thumb is that the last significant figure in any stated answer should be of the same order of magnitude, i.e. in the same decimal position, as the uncertainty. For example,\n",

    "92.81\\pm 30 \\to 90 \\pm 30$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last case, the rounded result is a little smaller than the result but the error is so large that this is of no consequence. In other words, the $92.81$ is only one of many results that could have been obtained had the experiment been repeated many more times and values from at least $60 \\to 120$ are to be expected. In cases such as $92.5\\pm 0.35$, you might not want to round up either to $93$ or down to $92$. In this case the rounded number could be reported as $(0.92_5 \\pm 0.04) \\times 10^2$.\n",
