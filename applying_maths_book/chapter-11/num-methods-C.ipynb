    "Similar numerical methods to those used for single equations can be used to solve coupled or simultaneous ones. Coupled reactions are commonly found in chemical kinetics, MD simulations, enzyme kinetics, and catalysis; also in the decay of radioactive atoms as well as in the spread of diseases and the predator - prey type behaviour of animals. In each case, species interact or convert into one another and at least two differential equations are needed to describe this. In many cases, these sets of equations cannot be solved algebraically and a numerical method has therefore to be used. As an example, we deliberately start with a pair of equations that can be solved analytically, and this will allow comparison of the numerical solution with the algebraic one. The equations are\n",

Notice that the first equation $dy/dt = \\cdots$ is a function of $x$ and $t$ and the second a function of $y$ and $t$ but in general $dy/dt$ and $dx/dt$ could be functions of $x$, $y$, and $t$.

    "## 5.3 The Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR. An example of coupled equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique, that in a few hours at most, can vastly multiply the number of selected fragments of DNA by thousands to millions of times. The method has recently been widely used as a test for the presence of Covid-19 virus but has been used long before that to detect a whole range diseases caused by viruses, bacteria and parasites. Other methods can be used for many diseases but PCR has the advantage of being able to amplify minute amounts of DNA. This technique is also important as part of fingerprint detection. The technique was invented by K. Mullis in 1983. He subsequently shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 for his 'invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method' with M. Smith for his 'fundamental contributions to the establishment of oligonucleotide-based, site-directed mutagenesis and its development for protein studies'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The target, a double-stranded DNA molecule is initially denatured by heating into two single strands. This DNA had previously been split into segments of a few hundred to to a few thousand base pairs. The denaturing is a cooperative effect and occurs over a narrow temperature range, $90-95\\,^\\text{o}$C, see Kittel and Zimm-Bragg zippers, chapters 5, 5.2 and Chapter 7,13.5 respectively. The denaturing is the first stage of the PCR cycle. The narrow temperature range of both denaturing and also subsequent steps, described shortly, mean that very precise and rapid temperature control is required. Because of the cooperative nature of denaturing and extending DNA the Arrhenius equation does not generally apply when considering how rate constants change with temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two small oligonucleotides (typically $15-30$ base pairs) are chemically synthesised and that are complementary to sequences on opposite strands of the target DNA sequence (3' and 5' ends) and that flank the target to be amplified, are used as primers. To bind the primers to the single strands it is necessary to reform the H-bonds and enable $\\pi-\\pi$ stacking to occur which requires some cooling to the solution but there is a balance: cooling must not be too much otherwise the the single strands recombine. However, if there is no cooling there is too much energy and the H bonds and pi-stacking cannot occur, i.e. unless cooled the equilibrium is too far towards separated primer and single stranded DNA species. This step is called 'annealing' or 'hybridisation'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The third stage is to convert the single strand with bound primer to form the new double stranded DNA and this is achieved by a DNA polymerase (protein) enzyme. This is called 'extension' or 'elongation'. This should be done at the optimum temperature for the polymerase ($68-72\\,^\\text{o}$C). The most commonly used polymerase is the heat resistant enzyme initially isolated from the bacterium _Thermus aquaticus_ ('Taq Poly') that lives in hot springs and can resist ($100\\,^\\text{o}$C).  Because DNA always pairs bases as G-C and A-T the DNA single strand makes a template on which to form an identical double stranded DNA using the nucleotides (i.e. base-sugar-phosphate molecules or dNTPs) present in solution.  The chain is completed when the new DNA is produced and fed-back in the denaturing step.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first cycle, each target molecule of DNA has been copied twice thus the number of DNA copies is doubled, and after, for example $25$ cycles there are $2^{25} \\approx 33\\cdot 10^6$ copies. The mixture to perform the PCR, besides buffer, are the DNA fragments to be copied, the primer sequence, often artificially synthesised, the Taq polymerase and the nucleotide bases (dNTPs).\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect the DNA a fluorphore can be used, and this can have great sensitivity because single photons can easily be detected. There are several strategies, the simplest is to use a dye that is largely non-fluorescent when in solution but when intercalated into the DNA becomes highly fluorescent. Other methods use a dye-quencher molecule such that when it is bound the dye and quencher are separated and the fluorescence yield increases dramatically. Similarly to this two dyes may be linked in the same molecule and undergo Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) when close to one another but not when kept apart. \n",

    "\n",
    "Each of these steps has to occur at a different temperature so this has to be closely controlled, being raised and lowered as necessary to move the reaction towards product. The order is $95 \\to 72 \\to 85$ which is then repeated. To calculate this numerically the rate constants have to be temperature dependent. This is done in two ways, the enzyme reaction is very specific and so a Gaussian temperature profile is used. If the temperature is too high or too low the rate constant tends to zero, i.e. $k_2$ (see below) varies as $k_2\\exp(-(T_0-T)^2/\\sigma)$. All the other rate constants $k_i$ must have a value of zero below a critical temperature and so are given the sigmoidal form $k_i/(1+\\exp(-(T_0-T)/\\sigma_0)$ which rises from zero below $\\approx T_0$ to a _constant_ value $k_i$ above: $\\sigma_0$ controls how fast the function rises, but should be only a few degrees. For simplicity the temperature profile was made sinusoidal (rather than stepwise) with a period of $60$ seconds starting at the highest temperature.

The wavefunction can be normalised at the end of the calculation ($\\int\\psi dx=1$) so these values are not critical. The function $f$ is known at all points via $V(x)$  but as noted the eigenvalue $E$ must be known.

This method does not perform well when, for example, the potential has a double well and in conjunction with the shooting method because numerical precision becomes an issue.
