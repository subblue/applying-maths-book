    "### 4 Basic properties of Matrices\n",
    "The rest of this chapter describes the properties and uses of matrices. The determinant described in the previous sections can be considered as one of the many properties of a matrix. In several places, reference is made to eigenvalues and eigenvectors before they have been fully explained, which is done in Section 12.3. The meaning of these words is outlined below but how they are obtained is left unanswered for the moment.\n",
    "The eigenvalue - eigenvector equation is met, for example, in solving problems in Quantum Mechanics and Chemical Kinetics and has the form,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle  \\mathrm{operator \\times function = constant \\times same\\; function}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "provided the function is not zero. In matrix form, the eigenvector - eigenvalue equation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{Ax}=\\lambda \\pmb{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\pmb A$ is an $n \\times n$ square matrix, $\\pmb x$ is one of $n$, one-dimensional column matrices (column vectors) and each one is called an eigenvector, $\\lambda$  represents one of $n$ numbers, and each $\\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Addition and subtraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "To add or subtract two matrices they must have the same shape. To add or subtract a constant or another matrix their individual elements are added or subtracted. Similarly, to multiply or divide by a constant number (a scalar), each element is also multiplied or divided by this value. Multiplying two matrices together is more complicated and depends on the order with which this is done and the shapes of the two matrices; sometimes it is just not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation used, is that bold italic letters indicate a matrix and the numbers $\\pmb 0$ and $\\pmb 1$ for the null and unit matrix respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose two matrices are $\\displaystyle \\pmb{A}=\\begin{bmatrix} 2&1&5\\\\-5 & 2 & 6\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\displaystyle \\pmb{B}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1&10&8\\\\-3 & 3 & 9\\end{bmatrix}$ calculating \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{A}+\\pmb{B},\\; \\pmb{A}-\\pmb{B},\\;\\pmb{3A}+\\pmb{0.5B}\\quad\\text{etc.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is easy, for example, taking elements individually,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{A}+\\pmb{B}=\\begin{bmatrix} 3&11&13\\\\-8 & 5 & 16\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and similarly for the other calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Division**\n",
    "One matrix _cannot_ be divided by another; the inverse matrix of the divisor is formed instead and then these matrices are multiplied together. The inverse of a matrix $\\pmb M$ is always written as $\\pmb{M}^{-1}$. Generating the inverse of a matrix is difficult unless the matrix is small, and one would normally use Python/Sympy to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Multiplication**\n",
    "Matrices can be multiplied together. The multiplication order is always important; $\\pmb{AB}$ is not necessarily the same as $\\pmb{BA}$. With three or more matrices $\\pmb{ABC}$, the multiplication sequence does not matter as long as the ordering is the same. This is the associatite property\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{ABC}\\equiv \\pmb{A}(\\pmb{BC})\\equiv (\\pmb{AB})\\pmb{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\pmb{BC}$ are multiplied first, then the result left multiplied by $\\pmb{A}$, this is the same as multiplying $\\pmb{AB}$ to form a new matrix, $\\pmb{D}$ for example, then performing the multiplication $\\pmb{DC}$. Habitually, we start at the right and multiply the $\\pmb{BC}$ pair first then left multiply by $\\pmb{A}$. The details are described in Section 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few special matrices and several types operations that can be performed on matrices and these are describe next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 The zero or null matrix\n",
    "As you would expect it is possible to have a matrix of zeros; adding this to another matrix changes nothing, but multiplying by it annihilates the other matrix leaving only the zero matrix as you would expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{0}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & \\cdots \\\\0 & 0 \\cdots \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\pmb{A}+\\pmb{0} =\\pmb{A};\\; \\pmb{A0}=\\pmb{0};\\; \\pmb{0A}=\\pmb{0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 The unit or identity matrix  $\\pmb{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a matrix of unit diagonals with all other elements being zero. The unit matrix is also called the _multiplicative identity_.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{1}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0& \\cdots \\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\cdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ \\vdots  & & &\\ddots\\end{bmatrix}\\qquad \\pmb{A1}=\\pmb{A};\\; \\pmb{1A}=\\pmb{A}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Diagonal matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a matrix whose diagonals can take any value, but all other elements are zero. The unit matrix is a special case. In general\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\begin{bmatrix} a & 0 & 0& \\cdots \\\\0 & b & 0 &\\cdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & c & 0\\\\ \\vdots  & & &\\ddots\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Trace or character of a matrix\n",
    "The trace, spur, or character of any matrix $\\pmb M$, is the sum of its diagonal elements only, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle Tr(\\pmb{M})=\\sum_{i=0}a_{i,i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for example \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{M}= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 3 & -1 & 0  \\\\ 0 & 4 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad Tr(\\pmb{M})= -1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By multiplying out the product of matrices, the trace of the product is found to be unchanged if they are permuted cyclically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Tr(\\pmb{ABC}) = Tr(\\pmb{CAB}) = Tr(\\pmb{BCA})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This fact is very useful in group theory because the trace of a matrix forms a _representation_ of a molecule's symmetry. Because of this rule, the trace, and hence representation, is independent of the basis set used to describe the symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Matrix transpose $\\pmb{M}^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "The transpose operation replaces rows and columns with one another, and so  exchanges element $(1, 2)$ with $(2, 1)$, and $(1, 3)$ with $(3, 1)$ and so on. For example;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f   \\end{bmatrix}^T= \\begin{bmatrix} a & d \\\\b & e\\\\ c & f \\end{bmatrix}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and for a square matrix this operation leaves the diagonal unchanged\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\g & h & i  \\end{bmatrix}^T= \\begin{bmatrix} a & d & g\\\\b & e & h\\\\ c & f & i\\end{bmatrix}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "You can appreciate that two transposes reproduce the initial matrix $(\\pmb{M}^T)^T = \\pmb{M}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _symmetric_ matrix is equal to its transpose and therefore must also be square and have off-diagonal elements $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. An _antisymmetric_ matrix satisfies the identity $\\pmb{A} = -\\pmb{A}^T$ and must therefore have zeros on its diagonal and have components $a_{ij} = -a_{ji}$; for example, such a matrix and its transpose is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 3 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 4 \\\\-3 & -4 & 0  \\end{bmatrix}^T= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 3\\\\2 & 0 & -4\\\\ 3 & 4 & 0\\end{bmatrix}=-\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 3 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 4 \\\\-3 & -4 & 0  \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",

    "In an orthogonal matrix, rows and columns form an _orthonormal basis_ and each row has a length of one. When an orthogonal matrix operates on (linearly transforms) a vector or a matrix representing an object, such as a molecule, the molecule is unchanged, meaning that relative bond angles and lengths remain the same but the coordinate axes moved so the object appears to have been rotated when viewed on the computer screen. Orthogonal matrices are used to represent reflections, rotations, and inversions in molecular group theory. Matrix decomposition methods make use of orthogonal matrices.

The _ket_ $|k\\rangle$  is a single column matrix (a column vector) $\\displaystyle | k\\rangle =\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ \\vdots \\end{bmatrix}$ and the _bra_  is the single row matrix (or vector) and is always the complex conjugate of the ket. $\\displaystyle \\langle j|=\\begin{bmatrix} a^* & b^* & \\cdots \\end{bmatrix}$. The $\\langle j |k\\rangle$ is a scalar number, and $|k\\rangle \\langle j|$ a square matrix.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 5.3 Commutators\n",
    "If matrices are not square then there is only one way to multiply them: the left-hand matrix's number of columns must equal the right-hand matrix's number of rows. When both matrices are square, to be multiplied they must be of the same size and we can then choose which is to be the left-hand and which the right-hand side of the multiplication, and now the _order_ of multiplication does matter as illustrated on the previous page. Sometimes the result is the same, i.e. $\\pmb{AB} = \\pmb{BA}$ then the matrices are said to *commute*, but generally they do not and, therefore, $\\pmb{AB} \\ne \\pmb{BA}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes expressions such as $[\\pmb{C},[\\pmb{A,B}]]$ may be met. This means: work out the inside commutation first, then the commutation with each term that this produces: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle [\\pmb{C},[\\pmb{A},\\pmb{B}]] = [\\pmb{C}, \\pmb{AB} - \\pmb{BA}] = [\\pmb{C}, \\pmb{AB}] - [\\pmb{C}, -\\pmb{BA}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Commutation is very important in quantum mechanics; only observables that commute can be observed simultaneously. Position and momentum, which do not commute, or those components of angular momentum, which also do not commute, have values that are restricted by an amount determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle when being observed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commutation is common of operators in general. The commutator relationship applies to any two operators $\\pmb{P}$ and $\\pmb{Q}$, which need not be matrices, but could be the differential operator such as $d/dx$ or $x$ itself. This parallel means that we can consider matrices as operators. The commutator will in general operate on a function, for example,\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle [\\pmb{P},\\pmb{Q}]f= \\pmb{PQ}f - \\pmb{QP}f$$\n",

In molecular group theory, the five types of operators that are the identity, rotation, reflection, inversion, and improper rotation (combined rotation and reflection) sometimes commute with one another although this depends on the point group. Section 6 describes these operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the study of the theory of nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, a quantum mechanical description of nuclear spin is essential. To explore the rotation of the magnetization as used in inversion recovery, spin-echo, or a complicated two-dimensional experiment, such as COSY, requires the exponentiation of matrices (Levitt 2001). Exponentiation can only be performed by expanding the exponential and evaluating the terms in the series one by one as\n",

Similar expressions are formed with trig and log functions according to their expansion formula and with Taylor or Maclaurin series for other functions. The familiar relationship $e^Ae^B = e^{A+B}$ is only true if the matrices $A$ and $B$ commute. In Section 13.2 and 13.3 a transformation is describe which enables the exponential of a matrix to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.6 Block diagonal matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "In many instances, a matrix can be blocked into smaller ones symmetrically disposed along the diagonal. The result of this is that the problem reduces to the lesser one of solving several matrices where each is much smaller than the whole and is therefore more easily solved. Why should we bother with this if the computer can diagonalize any matrix we give it to do? The reason is that eigenvalues can more easily be identified within the basis set by doing the calculation this way. Recall that the basis set you choose to use, for example in a quantum problem, determines the ordering of elements in a matrix. Why does this matter? It matters because when the spectrum from a molecule is observed, which measures only the difference in energy levels, we would like to know what quantum numbers give rise to what spectral lines. If the matrix is a block diagonal one, then this is made somewhat easier because we know what parts of the basis set elements are involved because each block when diagonalized contains only that part of the basis set that was in it in the first place. If the whole matrix is diagonalized blind, as it were, and without thinking about the problem beforehand, this information can be lost because all the elements and hence eigenvalues can be mixed up. The elements in the basis set can be ordered in any way you want, and different basis sets can be chosen for the same problem. By trying different ordering, it is sometimes possible to discover a block diagonal form for a matrix and so aid its solution. In the study of group theory, blocking matrices proves to be a powerful way of determining the irreducible representation; see Section 6. \n",
