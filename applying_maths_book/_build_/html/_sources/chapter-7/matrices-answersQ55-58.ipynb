    "These vectors indicate the normal mode geometries as they represent the displacements of the two masses. The normal mode frequencies are calculated using equation 54, producing $m\\omega_1^2 =k$ and $m_2^2 =k(1+2n)$. The modes are that of two springs extending and one being compressed. The lower frequency mode $\\omega_1$ occurs when both masses move in the same direction and by the same amount so that the central spring is not compressed. The higher frequency occurs when the two masses approach one another and the central spring is compressed and extended. This problem is very similar to the example of the two pendulums and a spring.\n",

    "(c) The relative displacements in mode $Q_2$ are, as before, in the ratio $2m_O/m_C$. As the two bending vibrations are degenerate because of symmetry, they have a fixed phase with one another and the motion is in orthogonal directions. When both modes are considered together when they are exactly $90^\\mathrm{o}$ out of phase with one another then the atoms' motion would appear to be circular.

    "Looking at the columns, the first has displacements all in the same direction so this must be a translation with zero frequency; the second eigenvalue $\\omega_2$ corresponds to the second eigenvector. This is an asymmetric stretch, as is the third. (We take motion about centre of molecule.) The fourth is the symmetric stretch. Drawing these three modes out makes this clear. Note that it doesn't matter which direction is positive since multiplying the vectors by $-1$ makes no difference, because on the other half of the vibration the arrows in the figure change direction. (You may need to check your own calculation because the eigenvector matrix may not be in the same order as here)\n",

    "The mode frequency ratios are in rough agreement with the measured frequencies; the two highest frequencies are for the asymmetric stretches, $\\omega_2$ and $\\omega_3$, and are similar in value. The symmetric stretch is lower in frequency, but experimentally, not nearly as low as this calculation suggests.\n",

    "The bending modes are calculated in a similar manner, with displacements perpendicular to the bonds. Only two of the displacements produce bends and their frequencies are $\\omega_5^2 = 1.098k_b$ and $\\omega_6^2 = 1.083k_b$. If we assume a single bending force constant $k_b$, which is less than that for the stretch, these two modes should correspond to the $612$ and $619\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ transitions but saying which is which with such a crude model of the potential energy, does not make sense at all. The bends are doubly degenerate because it does not matter for a bend in a linear molecule if it occurs in the plane of the drawing, as above, or at right angles to this.\n",
