You could now integrate this integral using Simpson's rule, for example, over the range $-8 \\to 8$ then use $t_0 = 0$, $y(t_0) = 3$ used to determine the integration constant $c$ which is $\\ln(3)$.\n",

    "Use Algorithm 13 with the potentials $U(r)=\\alpha/r$ or $U(r) = \\alpha e^{-\\beta r}/r$, and initially choose $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ to be unity. Do not forget to change the force as necessary in the calculation. In other respects, the calculation is similar to that in the example. As these potentials are repulsive when $\\alpha >0$ the trajectories should be scattered like a hard sphere. When $\\alpha \\lt 0 $ the Yukawa the potential is both attractive and repulsive, but in a gentler way than for the L-J potential. The result is shown in the next figure when $\\alpha=-1,\\; \\beta = 1$. The grey-scale shows the magnitude of the potential as a 'density'. The circle represents where the potential has its minima. \n",

The equation of motion is $\\displaystyle m\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+mc\\frac{dy}{dt}+mg=0$. $c$ is the damping coefficient with units of s${-1}$. The equation is solved using the Verlet method. If the initial height is large enough or the drag coefficient $c$ is increased then the ball's velocity becomes constant before bouncing due to the effect of the air resistance.\n",

However, the viscosity of the air offers resistance to the ball and its velocity reaches a maximum downwards (negative) value just before the ball hits the ground. The acceleration of the ball, which is the gradient of the velocity, is always decreasing. After bouncing, the acceleration is always changing and never reaches a constant value.\n",
