# # 1. Numbers, Equations, Operators, and Algorithms.

# In this chapter, some of the language of mathematics is introduced. Many of the calculations in this book are done using a computer program called Python which has various add-ons such as numpy/Scipy for fast calculation, matplotlib for graphing and SymPy for symbolic algebraic calculations. The syntax used and many of the instructions are described in Appendix 1 but some of the basic operations are also described here and the different usage compared to the way you would normally write mathematics. Mathematical symbols are listed in the Glossary.
