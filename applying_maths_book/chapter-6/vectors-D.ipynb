    "The $x, y$, and $z$-axes at $90^\\text{o}$ to one another are very familiar and the basis set of unit vectors $\\boldsymbol i, \\boldsymbol j, \\boldsymbol k$ can be used to describe any vector in these axes. These basis vectors  are orthogonal; geometrically they are each at $90^\\text{o}$ to one another and their dot product is zero. We have seen that $\\boldsymbol i\\cdot\\boldsymbol j = \\boldsymbol j\\cdot\\boldsymbol k = \\boldsymbol i\\cdot\\boldsymbol k = 0$ and that the vectors are normalized, $\\boldsymbol i\\cdot\\boldsymbol i = \\boldsymbol j\\cdot\\boldsymbol j = \\boldsymbol k\\cdot\\boldsymbol k = 1$; however, not all of the properties of molecules are represented in three dimensions. For instance, molecular orbitals need large basis sets. Benzene for instance, would need at least a six element basis set just to describe the $\\pi$ electrons alone. At the other extreme, we could have an infinite basis set, which is also quite common in quantum mechanical problems and would be needed to handle the infinite number of vibrational levels in a harmonic oscillator. Fortunately, a large basis set is handled in the same way as a small one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a four-dimensional set of unit vectors is made each one lying along one of four orthogonal axes. We cannot represent this geometrically in any easy way, but we can do so algebraically. The simplest way is to make a vector, row or column, containing the four elements and then to normalize it if necessary. In question 28 we used a wavefunction of the form $\\psi = a\\psi_s + b\\psi_{px} + c\\psi_{py} + d\\psi_{pz}$. This wavefunction is expressed in the basis set of one 2s and three 2p atomic orbitals $\\psi_s, \\psi_{px}, \\psi_{py}, \\psi_{pz}$. We assume that each of these orbitals are already orthogonal and normalized; i.e. that they form an orthonormal basis set. If they are not orthonormal then we have to perform a Gram - Schmidt orthogonalization procedure, which we need not delve into, but is described in more advanced texts such as Arkfen (1970).\n",

    "and the normalization and orthogonality is clear. Wavefunctions describing the eigenstates of a molecule or atom are orthogonal, but not necessarily normalized, and are used to calculate the expectation values of operators.

In fact, if the wavefunctions were to represent quantum mechanical 'spin', such as the spin properties of the electron or of a nucleus, the wavefunction is only known _symbolically_ and a vectorial approach is essential. \n",

    "\n",
    "In a molecule with $\\pi$ electrons, such as butadiene, we naturally want to form molecular orbitals in the basis of the carbon atom's 2p $\\pi$ orbitals. However, it is important to realize that as the $\\pi$ orbitals exist on different atoms this has implications for our basis set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using chemical intuition, we assume that all the orbitals are pointing in the same direction as shown in figure 25. As there are 4 p$\\pi$ orbitals in butadiene, we must form four MOs, and as there are also $4\\pi$ electrons, two orbitals will be bonding and two, anti-bonding, figure 25, but only the lower two orbitals are filled. The $\\pi$ orbitals point out of the plane formed by the atoms in the chemical structure, and out of the page as drawn, but they are turned through a right angle and viewed side-on in the lower part of the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we try to represent the molecular orbitals with a basis set $\\pi_1,\\;\\pi_2,\\;\\pi_3,\\;\\pi_4$, where the $\\pi$'s represent vectors on the $\\pi$ orbitals on each atom, then this would simply be wrong. This is because the orbitals are on _different_ atoms and so not based on the same axes but axes displaced from one another by the length and angle of the bonds. We would somehow need to relate $\\pi_2$ to $\\pi_1$ by allowing for each displacement and angle, and this would be very difficult and ultimately futile. We could still decide that the $\\pi$ orbitals are normalized by insisting that $\\vec \\pi_m\\cdot \\vec \\pi_m= 1$, where $m$ and $n$ are index numbers $1 \\to 4$, but we cannot expect that $\\vec \\pi_m\\cdot \\vec \\pi_n= 0$ because of the different coordinate origin of each orbital. It is difficult to know what $\\vec \\pi_m\\cdot \\vec \\pi_n will be, so we cannot very easily do the calculation in this basis set.\n",
    "\n",
    "An orthonormal basis set can, however, be found based on the $\\vec \\pi$ atomic orbital set above but now as linear combinations of these $\\pi$ orbitals. Suppose we make a set of four new vectors each of which is a _linear combination_ of the $\\vec \\pi$ orbital vectors and where the first vector $\\vec v_1 = a\\vec \\pi_1 + b\\vec \\pi_2 + c\\vec \\pi_3 + d\\vec \\pi_4$. We will need to calculate the constants $a, b, c, d$, but as each $\\vec \\pi$ vector is now based on its own coordinate on each atom $\\vec \\pi_m\\cdot \\vec \\pi_m= 1$ and $\\vec \\pi_m\\cdot \\vec \\pi_n= 0$, which confirms what is already known because atomic orbitals are orthonormal. The general and systematic way to find the coefficients is to use molecular group theory, but for small molecules we can often guess the linear combinations.\n",

This is true in benzene where some of the familiar shapes of the Huckel MO's are linear combinations; see matrices Q7 and Q50. To make a more accurate calculation of other orbitals besides the p$\\pi$, perhaps higher s or d orbitals must be added and then the basis set will have to expand. In molecular orbital calculations, a choice of predetermined basis sets of different complexity such as 631G can be used. Very often these basis sets consist of Gaussian functions ($ae^{-bx^ 2}$) parameterized with constants $a$ and $b$ to fit to Slater type atomic orbitals. Gaussian functions are used as they can be integrated easily. Huge basis sets containing millions of terms are necessary to represent molecular orbitals accurately and computer calculations of this type are very time consuming and among the most challenging of all calculations requiring super-computers."
