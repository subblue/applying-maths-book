    "## 15 Cross product or vector product\n",
    "The cross product of two vectors produces a vector rather than a scalar. This vector is at right angles to the other two; consequently, the cross product is unique to vectors in three- dimensional space. The symbol $\\times$ is used to indicate a cross product; some authors use $\\land $ although this less is common nowadays. \n",

It is easy to forget to do this. Because the cross product of a vector is perpendicular to either vector, the cross product of any vector with itself is always zero $\\vec u \\times \\vec u = 0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "In haemoglobin, the porphyrin has four N atoms roughly, but not exactly, in a plane surrounding the Fe, and similarly in chlorophyll-containing proteins found in photosynthetic organisms, the four N atoms surround the Mg. We often need to know how far an atom is from the plane of another molecule. A plane is determined by choosing three atoms not four. However, four atoms defining the plane would be more useful and, in this case, a best-fit plane to these four atoms is needed. This plane can be calculated using a matrix method similar to that used to determine moments of inertia, and this is described by least squares in chapter 13. When this plane is found, the equations developed in Sections 16 can be used to find distances.\n",

    "This result shows that the triple product is a number, hence the prefix 'scalar', because it is the determinant of the coefficients of the vectors and a determinant is equivalent to a number not a vector. It must follow that it does not matter in what order vectors occur in this triple product because the result is a number; $\\vec w\\cdot \\vec u \\times \\vec v = \\vec u\\cdot \\vec v \\times \\vec w$ etc.\n",

    "One important application of this product is to calculate the volume of a solid body that has the shape of a parallelepiped; this is a prism whose faces are all parallelograms. If the body is _right angled_ and with vectors $\\vec a, \\vec b, \\vec c$ along its edges, then the determinant is diagonal and its value is $|abc|$, which is equal to the volume. In figure 36 the area of the base is $\\vec a\\times \\vec b$ and the volume this area multiplied by the projection of $\\vec c$ into $\\vec a\\times\\vec b$ which is $|\\vec c|\\cos(\\theta)$.\n",

    "If the axes are not orthogonal, such as the $a, b, c$ unit cell vectors of crystals, then the dot products are neither one nor zero but have to be calculated as described in equation 34 for a monoclinic crystal. Note that the angle defined in the monoclinic crystal is different to that in figure 36a. In general, for a parallelepiped the volume = $| \\vec w\\cdot\\vec u \\times \\vec v|$ and the absolute value is used to ensure that this is positive.\n",
