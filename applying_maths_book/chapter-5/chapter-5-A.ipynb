    "### **(i) The Mode-Locked laser**\n",
    "\n",
    "A mode-locked laser produces a continuous train of short light pulses and these can be very short indeed, just a few femtoseconds, for example $20\\cdot10^{-15}$ seconds, is quite easily obtained from a Ti-sapphire laser. In these lasers the gain material consists of Ti ions doped into $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ (sapphire) crystals. The short pulses are possible because the Ti ions are in a wide variety of environments so that their emission spectrum is wide. The connection between pulse width and energy(frequency) spread is $\\Delta t \\sim k/\\Delta \\nu$ where $k$ is a constant of order of unity. (The value of $k$ depends on the shape of the laser pulse, 0.44 for a gaussian shaped (transform limited) pulse). Thus a gas-laser with a narrow atomic emission line can only produce pulse of $\\sim 0.1$ ns but a Ti sapphire laser with a fwhm of $\\sim 700 \\to 900$ nanometres which is a frequency spread of $\\Delta \\nu \\approx 3175\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ can potentially produce a pulse of $\\Delta t = 10$ fs duration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the laser is running in a continuous way (continuous wave or cw), in this case the phases of the waves is random. This means that the standing waves at each of many wavelengths that exist in the cavity are oscillating independently of one another. To make a pulse these modes have all to be made to oscillate together, i.e. in phase with one another, thus these numerous modes must be locked together. Mode-locking can be produced in a variety of ways but this always involves modifying the 'gain' in the laser cavity, where 'gain' means the amplification of the light.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the the laser cavity is perturbed in some way it is possible for the most intense part of the circulating light to produce more gain at the expense of the less intense parts. These more intense modes will then become more intense and so on, and eventually more of them become locked together simply because these are the only ones left with any amplitude. The result is that a pulse moves end to end in the cavity with a small amount of this being lost through the output coupler mirror each round trip which produces a train of pulses. Each pulse is separated by the round trip time $2L/c$ seconds from its neighbour, where $L$ is the path-length in the laser and $c$ the speed of light, thus for a $1.5$ m cavity pulses are produced $10$ ns apart. The perturbation to start mode-locking can be in the form on an acoustic modulator inside the cavity, a saturable absorber or in the case of Ti-sapphire lasers by tapping one mirror. This minor motion causes the gain to oscillate and so a pulse is formed as the most intense part of this stimulates more photons and so on to form a pulse. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total electric field of the radiation inside the cavity has very many modes, these are called *longitudinal* modes (Svelto, 1982). Such a mode is a wave that that has an integer number $n$ of half wavelengths and so fits exactly into the cavity. Not all wavelengths will do this and so do not exist in the laser output. At a wavelength $\\lambda_n$ the condition is $n\\lambda_n/2 = L$. However, at a slightly different wavelength $(n+1)\\lambda_{n+1}=2L$ is also true. The typical length for a mode-locked laser is $1.5$ m and if the wavelength is $800$ nm then $n=3750000$ making the next mode at a wavelength of $3/3750001= 799.99978$ nm thus these modes are extremely close in wavelength, and consequently there are a vast number of modes making up the laser pulse. Instead of calculating the change in wavelength frequency can be used making the  separation of the modes $\\Delta \\nu=c/2L$ Hz or $\\tau=2L/c$ seconds. The pulse moving round the cavity means that the phase of these modes is locked together and it is this effect that makes the pulse; random phases of sine waves would cancel one another out, see fig 18 in section 5.7 of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",

These could be a row of slits in a transmission grating or reflective strips in a reflection grating but in either case the sources are all in phase and emit over all angles. Thy could also be water waves or scattered off atoms by x-rays. If we observe at some distant point, a distance many times larger than the grating period $d$, and at an angle $theta$ we would like to know how the intensity of the summed waves varies as $\\theta$ is changed.

    "## 1.4  Average concentration from the time course of drug action\n",
    "\n",
    "When an antibiotic is administered the course normally lasts for several days, typically with tablets taken $2$ or $3$ times daily. The medication has to enter the blood stream to be dispersed to other organs, then acts on its target site and from here or from the blood it is excreted. Ideally, when taken the drug's concentration rises rapidly compared to its removal and thus gradually decreases in concentration as time proceeds. It rises rapidly again with each dose taken. The concentration vs time therefore has a saw-tooth profile whose *average* value rises initially then reaches a steady value. An oscillating steady value may be reached when the amount decayed  balances the amount added in the dose. If the time between doses is to large, the steady state can never be reached in a sensible amount of time. Conversely, if the time between doses is too short the accumulated amount may become far too large to be a safe dose. An alternative way of calculating the time profile is given in Chapter 9-7.3 (Fourier Transforms). \n",

To make the equations simpler we shall ignore species B, and suppose that species A is instantaneously populated, such as by intra-venous injection, and further that A decays by first order kinetics.

    "Figure 1c, below, shows the function of equation (3) and several approximations which are ever longer series with increasing powers of $x$. Expanding the series as far as $x^6$ only matches the $f(x)$ well up to about $x = 0.5$ indicating the rather obvious fact that that many terms may be needed to accurately reproduce a function. The plot also shows haw a function may be approximated by its first couple of terms when the variable $x$ is very small.  This is a very common procedure to account for a perturbation."

    "## 3 Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "In summing a series, it is important to ensure that it converges to some sensible expression such as $1/(1 - x)$, and is not going to be infinite or undefined. With many series, the summation is infinite and cannot therefore be expressed in a simple form. There are a number of convergence tests to ensure that a series has a finite result; many of these are complex, but a ratio test is a good way of determining if the series will be finite.\n",
    "In the ratio test, the ratio of any term $w$ in the series to its preceding term is calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle r=\\lim_{n=+\\infty} \\left| \\frac{w_{n+1}}{w^n} \\right| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and then the limit is taken as $n$ tends to infinity. If the $(n + 1)$<sup>th</sup> term is smaller than the $n^th$, then the series is converging. The second step is to check whether $r \\lt 1$, as $n$ goes to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the series expansion of $\\displaystyle (1 - x)^{-1} = 1 + x + x^2 \\cdots$ any individual term in the series is $x^n$ so the ratio $\\displaystyle r = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left| \\frac{x^{n+1}}{x^n} \\right | = |x|$ is less than 1 only if $|x| \\lt 1$; therefore when this is true the series converges. The interval of convergence for this sum is 0 $\\le x \\lt 1$, and the radius of convergence $s = 1$. For any other values this series diverges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Should the radius $s$ be infinity the series is convergent for all values of $x$; for instance, the exponential series is convergent for all $x$. Testing for convergence properly is far more complicated than this example leads us to believe and a maths textbook should be consulted to understand how to do this rigorously.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a series converges if $x$ is smaller than some number $s$, so that $|x_0 - x| \\lt s$ where $x_0$ is a displacement about which the series converges; see Section 6 describing Taylor series for examples of this. The number $s$ can be determined from the convergence test, Fig. 2. A useful property is that if a power series converges to some number and if each term of it is differentiated, the resulting series can be shown also to converge.\n",

Two different averages are frequently taken to characterize the polymer; one is the number average mass, the other the weight average mass. The reason for having two averages is two fold. Since there in not single polymer length (or mass) but a distribution of these measures of the shape/width of this distribution is needed to characterise the polymer. Secondly the number average is measured by colligative properties such as osmosis, whereas size/mass is measured by light scattering.\n",

    "Our DNA is packaged into $46$ chromosomes (22 pairs and 2 sex chromosomes) but each chromosome is still too vast to analyse and so it is broken into more manageable pieces by mechanical or chemical or enzymatic means.

It is assumed that the DNA is initially so long, $\\sim 10^6$ base pairs, that there are equal amounts of GCAT bases. If the sequence to identify is $n=8$ bases long and is GGCATGGA then the chance of finding the first G is $1/4$ and of the second adjacent G is $ 1/16$ and as each event is independent of any other the probabilities multiply to give $\\displaystyle p=\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{4}\\cdots= \\frac{1}{4^n}$, thus for $n=8$ the chance of finding any specified consecutive sequence is very small $1/4^8=1/65536$.

To detect an 8-mer the fragment will, of course, have to have on average at least these many bases since we do not know before hand if the sequence is present.

In the case of CO the calculated and experimental values agree well, both at $197.6$ J/mol/K, but the case of I$_2$ where the internal entropy is $88.7$ J/mol/K and the translational one $177.9$ make the total $266.5$. This is quite a bit larger than the experimental value of $260.7$ J/mol/K. Possibly this is due to the formulas describing the energy levels not being sufficiently accurate for higher vibrational and rotational levels, since the same trend also occurs with chlorine but to a smaller extent."
