    "Euler's formula is important in science, because it permits the description of a sinusoidally varying real quantity by means of complex exponentials as in Fourier Transforms described in Chapter 9. This change simplifies equations, because it is far easier to manipulate exponentials than trig functions. For example, the general form of a sinusoidally varying quantity, such as a plane wave, is $f (t) = a_0\\cos(\\omega t - \\theta)$, where $a_0$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ the frequency, and $\\theta$ the phase. These are all constants, and $t$ is time and is a real variable. The equivalent complex function is\n",

    "\n",
    "therefore $f(t) = Re(g(t))$. Very often in chemistry and physics, the complex form is used without explicitly stating that it is only the real part that represents the waveform. Figure 7 compares these waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of using Euler's equation, we will evaluate $w = \\ln(-1)$ even though it doesn't exist as a pure real number, then calculate $w = \\ln(i)$ and $w = \\ln(z/3)$, where $z$ is any complex number. The strategy in problems of this type is to convert the number $-1$, or $i$, or whatever it is into an exponential form using Euler's theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** In the first example, $w = \\ln(-1)$ or $e^w = -1$ and $w$ has to be found to solve this equation. A general complex number can always be written as $z = re^{i\\theta}$, therefore to find $w$, let $w = i\\theta$. The absolute value (modulus) $r$ of $e^w$ is $e^{i\\theta}e^{-i\\theta} = 1$. Because $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i \\sin(\\theta)$, when $\\theta = \\pi$, $e^{i\\theta} = -1$ making the principal value of $\\ln(-1) = \\ln(1e^{i\\pi}) = i\\pi$, which, obviously, is a complex number. Note that there are other values of $\\theta$ separated by $2k\\pi i$, where $k$ is an integer because $e^{i\\theta}$ is a cyclic function.\n",

    "\n",
    "**(c)** If $w = \\ln(z/3)$, then $3e^w = z$, and if $z$ is any complex number then we look for a value of $\\theta$ such that $3e^{i\\theta} = z$. Generally a complex number is represented by $z = re^{i\\theta}$, then in this example $w = \\ln(z) = \\ln(3e^{i\\theta}) = \\ln(3) + i(\\theta + 2\\pi k)$ and $2\\pi k$ is added because the function is cyclic and $k$ is any integer; recall that the Euler equation can be put into a cosine and sine form, so it is a repetitive function. The principal value occurs when $k = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to example (i), $w = \\ln(-1)$, if the $-1$ is treated as a complex number with an imaginary part that is zero, then the answer can be written down directly as $w = \\ln(-1) = \\ln(re^{i\\theta}) = \\ln(1) + i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)$\n",

    "## 4.3 x-ray diffraction intensity. The Structure Factor and Phase Problem \n",
    "In chapter 9, (Fourier Series and Transforms) and in section 13.6, x-ray diffraction by a single crystal is described. The structure factor $F$ described how the intensity of a given 'reflection' is related to the coordinates of the atoms in the unit cell _via_ the Miller indices $( h k l )$ of the planes of atoms. The Miller indices are integers that can be positive, zero or negative. The planes of atoms occur because the unit cell is repeated throughout the crystal to form a lattice of points. The unit cell is the smallest arrangement of atoms from which the whole crystal can be constructed. \n",

    "\n",
    "### **(i) The phase problem**  \n",
    "The intensity of the diffracted spot is $I=|F|^2=F^*F$  which means that the series of terms in $F$ has to be multiplied by its complex conjugate. The term $f_i$ is the atomic scattering factor for each type of atom relative to that of a single electron. Electrons in an atom that predominantly scatter the x-rays and as $f_i$ is proportional to the number of electrons, scattering is larger for heavy atoms than light ones. See Chapter 9-13.6 for details. Notice in particular that the structure factor *does not depend on the shape or size of the unit cell*, but on the fractional positions of the atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the detector, e.g. CCD or photon counting array, always measures the intensity $F^*F$ is the reason the _phase problem_ exists which makes interpreting X-ray diffraction data somewhat complicated. To illustrate, if there are only two atoms then eqn. 21 becomes\n",

    "\n",
    "and we know $f_0$ and $f_1$ as these _atomic_ structure factors can be calculated. However, with one measurement there are two unknowns in the difference term. The $hkl$ values are known from the positions of the diffracted spots on the detector ( the image has been *indexed* ), and so a second measurement can be made with different $k,h,l$, producing say $\\beta_1-\\beta_2$, but the atomic positions are the same and this process can be continued producing a set of difference equations which can be solved until the structure is determined, i.e. the $u_i,v_i,w_i$ are known. In particular cases some simplification is possible as shown next.\n",

An atom is at each corner and one atom in the base of the cell, (The second (top) atom is the base of the unit above). On the right is a body-centered unit cell.\n",

    "Figure 7a. (a) Base-centred and (b) body-centred orthorhombic unit cells.\n",
    "________\n",
    "\n",
    "In the base centred unit cell there are only two distinct atoms positions located at positions $0, 0, 0$ and at $1/2, 1/2, 0$ and together with their the axes $a,b,c$ will produce the crystal structure.  We shall consider that the atoms are of the same kind and so the atomic scattering factor is the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The series for $F$ has two terms which are\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle F=f(1 +e^{2i\\pi(h/2+k/2+0)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we can form the complex conjugate and calculate \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle F^*F=f^2(1 +e^{-i\\pi(h+k)})(1 +e^{+i\\pi(h+k)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "in this case it is not necessary because $h, k, l$ are integers and we know that $e^{n i\\pi}=e^{-n i\\pi}=(-1)^2$. Thus when $h+k$ is an even number $F=2f$ and when it is not $F=0$. The value of $l$ has no effect thus refections from indices, for example, $131, 132, 133$ etc. all have the same intensity, and similarly $122,123,124$ etc. are all missing with zero structure factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct calculation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\begin{align}F^*F&=f^2(1 +e^{-i\\pi(h+k)})(1 +e^{+i\\pi(h+k)})\\\\&=f^2(2+e^{-i\\pi(h+k)}+e^{+i\\pi(h+k)})\\\\&=2f^2\\big(1+\\cos(\\,(h+k)\\pi \\,)\\big)\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and when $k+k$ is an odd number $\\cos(\\pi(h+k))=-1$ making $F=0$ and when $h+k$ is even the intensity is $4f^2$.  Because the detected intensity is $4f^2$ heavy atoms, with more electrons have far 'brighter' spots that do H atoms, meaning that it is far more difficult to detect the latter. \n",

    "\n",
    "The NaCl crystal has a cubic structure with $4$ Na and $4$Cl in the unit cell. The coordinates (as fractions of the unit cell sides) are\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\begin{array}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{Na} & 0, 0, 0 & 1/2, 1/2, 0 & 1/2, 0, 1/2  & 0, 1/2, 1/2 \\\\\n",

    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and then the structure factor is the sum\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\begin{align}F=&f_{Na}(1+e^{i\\pi(h+k)}+e^{i\\pi(h+l)}+e^{i\\pi(k+l)} )\\\\+&f_{Cl}(e^{i\\pi(h+k+l)}+ e^{i\\pi(l)}+e^{i\\pi(k)}+e^{i\\pi(h)})\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity $F^*F$ will contain $16$ terms and we could go ahead and calculate all the exponentials which because $h,k,l$ are integers will be $\\pm 1$. This suggest that some simplification is possible and this is true for the chlorine terms where  $e^{i\\pi(h+k+l)}$ can be factored out giving\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\begin{align}F=&f_{Na}(1+e^{i\\pi(h+k)}+e^{i\\pi(h+l)}+e^{i\\pi(k+l)} )\\\\+&f_{Cl}e^{i\\pi(h+k+l)}(1+ e^{i\\pi(-h-k)}+e^{i\\pi(-h-l)}+e^{i\\pi(-k-l)})\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and using $e^{ni\\pi}=e^{-ni\\pi}$ gives, after rearranging\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle F=\\left(1+e^{i\\pi(h+k)}+e^{i\\pi(h+l)}+e^{i\\pi(k+l)} \\right)\\left(f_{Na}+f_{Cl}e^{i\\pi(h+k+l)}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which will be zero if any two of the exponentials $e^{i\\pi(h+k)}, e^{i\\pi(h+l)}, e^{i\\pi(k+l)}$ is negative. This will be the case if any two of $ h, k, l $ is an odd number and the other even or vice versa, i.e. the integers are mixed odd and even.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that each $h, k, l$ is even or each odd  then $1+e^{i\\pi(h+k)}+e^{i\\pi(h+l)}+e^{i\\pi(k+l)}=4 $ and then $F_{even}=4(f_{Na}+f_{Cl})$ and if odd $F_{odd}=4(f_{Na}-f_{Cl})$ and the intensity is then the square of these values. Notice that the 'odd' intensity may be quite small as it depends on the difference in atomic structure factors which is small if the atoms are close in atomic number and, of course, zero for the same type of atoms."
