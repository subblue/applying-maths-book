    "## 14 Molecular vibrations\n",
    "Matrix eigenvalue - eigenvector problems can also be used to solve a number of related problems such as molecular vibrations, coupled pendulums, and damped oscillators. When the displacements from equilibrium are small the equations produced are linear, and this is always assumed in solving these equations with matrix methods. The numerical methods of Chapter 11 allow the fully non-linear equations to be solved. In this section, the concept of normal modes is described first, then the motion of linked pendulums, and finally the vibrational motion of molecules is described and some examples worked through.\n",

    "If the initial displacements made to the atoms of a molecule correspond to that expected of any one of the normal modes, Figure 23, then the oscillations of all atoms continue only in that normal mode. The first reason is because each atom is connected to all others via chemical bonds, and second because each normal mode is orthogonal to every other one. This means that, ideally, no energy flows from one normal mode to any other, and although this happens in practice, for example due to an harmonicity, it need not concern us here. If an arbitrary initial displacement is made that does not correspond to that expected of a normal mode, a complicated motion results. However, this can always be decomposed to a linear combination or sum of the normal modes, taken in various proportions as necessary to describe the motion. The overall motion, when many modes are simultaneously excited, causes beating; this is particularly clear in a coupled pendulum as the two pendulums come into and go out of phase with one another. This is seen when one of the pendulum bobs becomes stationary for an instance while its partner swings maximally; this then loses energy and becomes instantaneously stationary while the other has gained maximum displacement and which continues by swapping energy _ad infinitum_.\n",

    "In a mechanical or molecular vibration, we usually try to find the equation relating forces. In simple harmonic motion, such as stretching a chemical bond, the potential energy is by Hooke's law, $V = ks^2/2$, where $k$ is the force constant and $s$ the amount the bond extends away from its equilibrium length. The force $f$ to stretch the bond, is obtained by differentiation of $\\displaystyle f=-\\frac{dV}{ds}=-ks$ and is also given by Newton's second law; force = mass $\\times$ acceleration, $\\displaystyle f=m\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$ which provides the connection to time.

    "Using the matrix method to solve problems of this type is best described with an example. The most difficult part is always obtaining the equation for the energy and therefore forces. In this example, the motion of two identical pendulums will be calculated. They have length $L$ and mass $m$ at the end of rigid, mass-less rods, and the masses are coupled together with a spring with force constant $k$, Figure 59. The pendulums are initially at equilibrium separated by the un-extended length of the spring, and then energy is added by moving one or both of the individual pendulums by a very small amount so that Hooke's law for the spring is obeyed, and the change in potential, due to height, is directly proportional to the change in the vertical angle. There are two normal modes, see Figure 60. Either the pendulums swing together in phase both moving in the same direction at constant separation, or they move together and apart stretching and compressing the spring. These are clearly the only possible motions of the two pendulums for small angular motion and we shall want to find out their frequency (eigenvalues) and the normal mode displacements using the eigenvectors.\n",

Next, the energy due to compressing or extending the spring is found then, using the total potential energy, the forces are calculated.
