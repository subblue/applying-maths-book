    "The only change that has to be made in the case of benzene compared to the linear 1, 3, 5-hexatriene, is to add 1 to the matrix in the $(1, 6)$ and $(6, 1)$ positions, or $(1, n)$ and $(n, 1)$ generally. The calculation is the same as in Algorithm 1, but with $n=6$ because there are six carbon atoms each with one $\\pi$ electron, and changes to the two extreme elements, top right, bottom left, to unity from zero, to make the benzene structure cyclic. This can be done with a line added outside and after the last end do; to link the first to last atoms."

In the real molecule, the energy between the linear and triangular form is quite small and the triangular form is distorted by Jahn-Teller interaction and is not an isosceles triangle but an obtuse one.

The change in energy with angle above $60^\\text{o}$ is small but this may not be realistic in view of the crudeness of the model.

    "Now there are more than enough terms to try to relate these formulae to one another. If the suggested formula in the question is correct, then starting with $f_1$ and $f_2$ the recursion formula suggests that $f_3(x) = xf_2(x) - f_1(x)$. Using the values above $f_3(x) = x(x^2 - 1) - x$, which is the same equation as the characteristic equation calculated from the Huckel determinant for propene. The formula seems to be correct at least for these two terms. We can calculate another term as a check. For example, $f_5(x) = xf_4(x) - f_3(x)$ which is also correct, and as both examples work, this sufficient to 'prove' the recursion formula $f_n(x) = xf_{n-1}(x) - f_{n-2}(x)$.\n",

As the number of levels increase more energy levels (states), appear to have large positive and negative values and fewer at zero energy. When the number of electrons becomes very large, as in a semiconductor, the levels merge into a band and then relatively more energy levels appear at the band edges than at the band centre. This is the trend that is seen to be starting here. All the levels below zero are filled and as the molecule gets longer the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO orbitals becomes very small, rather line this of a 1D metal. \n",
