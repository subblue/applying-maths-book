    "## 13.1 Linear kinetic schemes\n",

    "The equations of chemical kinetics can quite easily become complicated even with simple schemes. The sequential scheme \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle A \\overset{k_1}\\to B \\overset{k_2}\\to C$$\n",

    "\n",
    "then solving the rate equations becomes a difficult task. When performing transient kinetics experiments using, for instance, the stopped-flow, flash - photolysis, or femtosecond pump - probe methods, the time profiles of the species present have to be calculated, so that they can be fitted to data to obtain rate coefficients. The transient species present, such as B above, are identified both by their time profile and by spectra. \n",
    "\n",
    "A kinetic scheme is always written in terms of the rate of change of the species present; for example, the first-order decay of species $A$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{dA}{dt}=-k_1 A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with rate constant $k_1$, which is in units of s$^{-1}$ is more properly called the _rate coefficient_.\n",
    "Conventionally we write the concentration of species $A$ as $[A]$ but for clarity we use $A$. Note that $A$ is a function of time, this is implied in the equations but almost never explicitly written down, which means that we rarely need to write $A(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first-order equation indicates that the rate of change of $A$ is negative; therefore, $A$ is decaying away and being changed into something else and it is doing so at a rate of $-k_1A\\;\\mathrm{ mol\\,dm^{-3}\\, s^{-1}}$. The rate at any time is thus proportional to how much of $A$ remains unreacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scheme,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\displaystyle A \\overset{k_1}\\to B \\overset{k_2}\\to C$$\n",

    "\n",
    "In solving these differential equations the initial conditions must always be defined. This means defining the concentration of all possible species present in the reaction scheme at time zero. Often it is assumed that only some amount of $A$ present is present, say $A_0$, and that $B_0 = C_0 = 0$. You will notice that, since we cannot create or destroy atoms in a chemical process, the total amount of all species is constant at all time, so that $A_0 + B_0 + C_0 = A + B + C$, which means that C can always be calculated as the difference $C = A_0 + B_0 + C_0 - A - B$ so there are really only two differential equations. However, if $C$ decomposes with time to another species, we cannot use this last relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know from direct integration that $\\displaystyle A = A_0e^{-k_1t}$, and from the theory of coupled linear differential equations that the solution in general for all species are _sums of exponential_ terms, see Chapter 10.7. If the initial concentration of $A = A_0$ and initially $B = C =0$, then the concentration of $B$ is\n",

    "which is of the form expected, with an exponential decay preceded by a grow-in, see Figure 55. Notice that $k_1$ cannot have the same value as $k_2$ as then the equation for the population would be $0/0$, which is undefined; but in fact there is no reason why these rate constants should not be equal, that is to say that $B$ is formed with the same rate constant as it decays. This special case is dealt with in Chapter 10.7(ii).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an extension to this scheme, suppose that A has an extra form of decay and rather than just forming B it also forms D with a rate constant $k_3$. This might be another chemical species or if A is an excited state, then D could be the ground state and A has fluoresced. Either way the scheme is  \n",

Notice that although $dB/dt$ is the same as in the scheme above B itself appears with rate constant $k_1+k_3$ which is the decay of A but only the fraction $k_1/(k_1+k_3)$ of A forms D. By inspecting the scheme, we can write down the decay of A and the appearance of D without any further calculation, giving\n",

    "\n",
    "## 13.2 Matrix solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using matrix methods changes the way the problem is solved into that of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, thereby avoiding the difficulty of integration, but it is only applicable to first order or linear equations; i.e. product terms such as $k_2AB$ are not allowed. For very complex schemes, consisting of hundreds of equations, the master equation approach is used and is usually solved numerically. A master equation is defined as a phenomenological, first-order differential equation, describing the time evolution of the probability of a 'system' to occupy any one of a discrete set of states.\n",

First the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are obtained from the secular determinant of the rate constants, then equation 39 is used to obtain the populations with time.

    "When the rate equations are more complex then a numerical solution is to be preferred simply because the equations can become impossibly complex. Consider a scheme (figure 55a) in which three species A, B, C are interconnected each with the others. We can see that equilibrium will be established for all three species as there is no pathway for any species to react other than to the others. We can also guess at the concentration vs time if only one species is populated initially, which is that this species decays and the others increase until equilibrium is reached.\n",

If, for instance, species $b$ decays such as by fluorescence or phosphorescence then $-k_f b$ is added to the summation term in the rate equation for that species. The limitation is that only first order, or pseudo first order, reactions are possible, i.e. the rate constant matrix must not involve and concentrations unless they have a constant value.\n",

    "### **Energy transfer on a Polygon. Circulant determinants**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we consider energy transfer between molecules equally spaced apart on a polygon. The determinant produced is similar to the $\\mathrm{H\\overset{\\cdot\\cdot}uckel }$ one described in section 2 although the problem is totally different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forster transfer, which operates by dipole-dipole energy transfer, is commonly used as a spectroscopic ruler to determine distances between molecules tagged with fluorophores. The process between donor and acceptor is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{ D^* + A \\to D + A^*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the * indicates an electronically excited molecule. In fact the donor and acceptor can be the same type of molecule, e.g. chlorophyll among many others, when there is overlap of absorption and emission spectra. The overlap ensures that some energy levels of the donor are above those of the acceptor. Various very similar types of chlorohyll are the chromophores used the first step in the light gathering process of the 'antenna' in photosynthesis. The LH2 and LH1 light harvesting antenna of bacterial photosynthesis has 18 or so chromophores arranged in a loop, which could be described as a regular polygon perhaps just as accurately as a circle. (The energy is now understood to be localised over the antenna for the first few tens of femtoseconds after photon absorption but here for the purposes of example in this idealised model, we shall suppose that discrete transfer between pigments always occurs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate constant is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle k =\\chi^2 k_f\\left(\\frac{r}{R_0}\\right)^6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_f$ is the intrinsic excited state decay rate constant and $R_0$ is a characteristic distance that depends on the overlap of the donor molecule's emission spectrum and the acceptor's absorption spectrum and is typically only a few nanometres. The orientation factor between the molecules dipoles is $\\chi^2$. The molecules' separation is $r$ which, for Forster transfer to be valid, must be much greater than a molecule's radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "If molecules are placed at the vertices of a regular polygon a set of first order rate equations can be written down to define the probability of finding excitation on any molecule at any given time. If the molecules are all of the same type and orientation, only one rate constant $k$ is needed. As time passes the excitation spreads out among all the molecules and if we suppose that the intrinsic decay rate constant (reciprocal fluorescence or excited state lifetime) is far smaller than that for energy transfer the population will come to an equilibrium value with equal excitation on each molecule. For simplicity the normal decay of the excited state is ignored.\n",
    "\n",

All the rate constants are the same because we choose only to consider nearest neighbours and the molecules are equally spaced from one another.\n",

    "and solve for $\\lambda$ using the polynomial formed by expanding the determinant.

These are described in the Chapter 9 on Fourier Series and Transforms.\n",

    "Before doing the calculation there is an important feature about the time profiles we already know. The $\\lambda$ are scaled rate constants, i.e. they are the rate constant $k$ multiplied by a negative number. When $j=0, \\lambda = -2k(1-\\cos(0))$ which is zero meaning that there is always a constant term in the population $p$ because $e^0 = 1$ indicating that equilibrium will always be reached when the other terms have decayed away. (We are ignoring here the fact that the molecules themselves can decay by fluorescence, intersystem crossing or internal conversion but we shall assume that an excited state is long lived compared to energy transfer and so is effectively infinitely long lived).

In the circulant matrices the $c$'s are always $\\pm 1$ and the $1/n$ makes the initial population at time zero equal to $1$ and the final population of all species $1/n$ when the energy is evenly spread out. \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation in python is shown below for the general case. The number of molecules is $6$ and this shows that the population of $1$ and $5$ are equivalent and both rise and then fall as energy passes through them and that molecules further away from that one initially excited (molecule 0) take longer to reach equilibrium. If you try this with larger $n$ you will see this behaviour is general and in line with what intuition would suggest."

    "## 13.3 Justification for the matrix method to solve coupled linear differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In using equation 38 to solve the scheme, the assumption is made that if $\\pmb{M}$ is a vector and $\\pmb{k}$ a matrix, we can write $d\\pmb{M}/dt = \\pmb{kM}$ and that its solution is $\\pmb{M} = \\pmb{M}_0e^{\\pmb{k}t}$. To show that this is valid, we work backwards and start with $\\pmb{M}$, which is differentiated term by term, after first expanding the exponential as a series. In Section 5.5 it was shown that the exponential of a matrix can only be manipulated by first expanding;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{d\\pmb{M}}{dt}=\\pmb{M_0}\\frac{e^{\\pmb{k}t}}{dt}=\\pmb{M_0}\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(1+\\pmb{k}t+\\frac{\\pmb{k}^2}{2!}t^2++\\frac{\\pmb{k}^3}{3!}t^3+\\cdots \\right)\\\\=\n",
    "\\pmb{M_0}\\pmb{k}\\left(1+\\pmb{k}t +\\frac{\\pmb{k}^2}{2!}t^2+\\cdots \\right) =\\pmb{kM_0}e^{\\pmb{k}t}=\\pmb{kM}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two steps, $\\pmb{k}$ has been separated out, and the remaining series identified as the first few terms of the exponential expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second equation, (39), used in the calculation, is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{M}(t) = \\pmb{X}[e^{\\lambda t}]\\pmb{X}^{-1}\\pmb{M}_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the form of this needs explaining. First, each value in the column vector $\\pmb{M}(t)$ represents the concentration of each species at time $t$, the column vector $\\pmb{M}_0$ holds the initial concentrations\n",
    "of the same species. The equation we start with is $\\pmb{M}(t) = \\pmb{M}_0 e^{-\\pmb{k}t}$. To solve this it has to be converted into $\\pmb{M}(t) = \\pmb{X}[e^{\\lambda t}]\\pmb{X}^{-1}\\pmb{M}_0$, and to do this a _similarity transform_ is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13.4 Similarity Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "In our study of molecular group theory, similar matrices were introduced. However, _similar_ matrices are used more generally. A square matrix $\\pmb{W}$ is described as being _similar or conjugate_ to another square matrix $\\pmb{N}$, if there exists a third, non-singular, square matrix $\\pmb{X}$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{W} = \\pmb{X}^{-1}\\pmb{NX} \\qquad\\tag{42}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then $\\pmb{X}^{-1}\\pmb{NX}$ is a similarity transform; $\\pmb{X}\\pmb{NX}^{-1}$ is also a similarity transform. A similarity transform is equivalent to changing the basis set of one matrix into another basis; this might also be considered a coordinate transformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If matrix $\\pmb{W}$ operates on an object, this is the equivalent of transforming the object (which could be a rotation), then operating on it by $\\pmb{N}$, which stretches or alters the object in some way (but does not rotate), then undoing the initial transformation with a further transformation (rotation in the opposite direction) with $\\pmb{X}^{-1}$. Thus, $\\pmb{W}$ performs the same operation as $\\pmb{N}$ but uses a different set of axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity transform is most useful in diagonalizing matrices, because, if a matrix $\\pmb{W}$ can be diagonalized and its matrix of eigenvectors $\\pmb{X}$ calculated, then $\\pmb{W}$ is _similar_ to the diagonal matrix of its eigenvalues $\\pmb{\\Lambda}$, where the eigenvectors $\\pmb{X}$ act as the similarity matrices. The diagonal matrix is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{\\Lambda} =\\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 &\\cdots \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2   & 0 &\\cdots  \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 &\\cdots \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots &\\vdots & \\ddots   \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation relating eigenvalues and the diagonal matrix of eigenvectors $\\pmb{\\Lambda}$ is $\\pmb{WX} = \\pmb{X\\Lambda}$. If we left multiply by the inverse eigenvector matrix $\\pmb{X}^{-1}$ then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{X}^{-1}\\pmb{WX} = \\pmb{\\Lambda} \\qquad\\tag{43}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a similarity transform. Of course, the inverse matrix $\\pmb{X}^{-1}$ must exist. In making a diagonal matrix, the original matrix has been 'rotated', as it were, so that all elements are zero except on the diagonal, the off-diagonal elements become incorporated into the diagonal ones. This 'rotation' or coordinate change analogy, is what is done when the principal axis are found when the moments of inertia of a body are calculated, see Section 15.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chemical kinetics, the diagonal matrix of the exponential values of the eigenvalues is used, i.e. eqn. 40,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle [e^{\\lambda t}] =\\begin{bmatrix} e^{\\lambda_1 t} & 0 & 0 & \\cdots \\\\ 0 & e^{\\lambda_2 t}   & 0 & \\cdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & e^{\\lambda_3 t} & \\cdots \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots &\\vdots & \\ddots \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "therefore, we need to show that we can use the similarity transform to make this matrix. Suppose there is a function of a matrix $\\pmb{f}(\\pmb{W})$, which is itself a matrix, then this can be expanded as a (Taylor) series with coefficients $a_i$, just as is done with an exponential or other normal function. A general power series is written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{f}(\\pmb{W})= a_0\\pmb{1}+a_1\\pmb{W}+a_2\\pmb{W}^2 +\\cdots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\pmb{f}(\\pmb{W})$ must commute with $\\pmb{W}$, then both matrices can be diagonalized simultaneously with a similarity transform. Using the eigenvector matrix $\\pmb{X}$ of matrix $\\pmb{W}$, then the similarity transform is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{X}^{-1}\\pmb{f}(\\pmb{W})\\pmb{X} = \\pmb{f}\\pmb{\\Lambda} \\qquad\\tag{44}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $\\pmb{f}(\\pmb{\\Lambda})$ is a diagonal matrix of function $f$. For instance, if $\\pmb{f}(\\pmb{W}) = e^{\\pmb{W}}$, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{X}^{-1}e^{\\pmb{W}}\\pmb{X} = e^{\\pmb{\\Lambda}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is used to solve equations in chemical kinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a matrix $\\pmb{M}$ is to be raised to its $n^{th}$ power, the function $\\pmb{f}(\\pmb{W})$ is then $\\pmb{M}^n$. The similarity transform becomes $\\pmb{X}^{-1}\\pmb{M}^n\\pmb{X} = \\pmb{\\Lambda}^n$, which can be rearranged to $\\pmb{M}^n=\\pmb{X}\\pmb{\\Lambda}^n\\pmb{X}^{-1} $ and so the equation can be used both ways round. This last expression is a very convenient way of raising a matrix to a large power, if $\\pmb{M}$ can be diagonalized and its eigenvalues $\\pmb{X}$ determined. The alternative method, is the repeated multiplication $\\pmb{MMMM}\\cdots$, which is impracticable should $n$ be large, $100$ for example.\n",

    "## 13.5 A Similarity Transform used to evaluate a partition function.  The helix-coil transition\n",
    "A polypeptide or a protein can change from a helix to a random coil structure or vice versa, over a small range of temperatures. This sudden change is suggestive of a cooperative process and Zimm & Bragg (1959) used a statistical model and calculated the partition function for a peptide chain consisting of two types of residues, either those that form a helix or those that do not. A section of protein will be described as having an unstructured coil if it has c type amino acids and h type if they are helix forming such as alanine. A portion of the chain could be $\\cdots cchccchhhcchh\\cdots$ . The statistical weight of a $\\cdots ch$ boundary and of continuing to grow a helix $\\cdots chhh$ once formed is calculated and this statistical weight is the Boltzmann contribution to the partition function or $e^{-\\Delta G/k_BT}$, where $\\Delta G$ is the change in free energy when the next residue is encountered along the chain. The model is successful despite the assumption of nearest neighbour interactions whereas a helix strictly involves interactions with residues that are not just nearest neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has the following rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i)**$\\quad$ The energy of the randomly coiled chain is taken as the baseline energy and it has a value of zero and a given a statistical weight of $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(ii)**$\\quad$ A section of helix is energetically favourable as hydrogen bonds are formed. The statistical weight given to a helix forming residue is $s$, if the helix is already formed, i.e. this is the statistical weight to add an $h$ if the preceding residue is also $h$. This is sometimes called a helix continuation parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(iii)**$\\quad$ The first helix forming residue must be at a $\\cdots ch$ boundary. There is an entropy term $\\sigma$ due to restricting the rotational motion of the residue on forming a helix from a coil, making the statistical weight $s\\sigma$. The value of $\\sigma$ is always less than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the calculation show that there is cooperativity in the helix-coil transition. When $\\sigma \\ll 1$ it is hard to form a helix, but once formed it is energetically favourable to continue to add only $h$ residues and the helix-coil 'phase transition' is sharp. Conversely, when $\\sigma \\sim 1$ there is no cooperativity in the transition and it occurs over a relatively wide range of temperature, which effectively means a large range of $s$ because $s$ is the Boltzmann contribution $e^{-\\Delta G/k_BT}$ to the partition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zimm & Bragg (1959) presented a matrix method to calculate the partition function sum, and they showed that the equation $\\pmb{A}_{n+1} = \\pmb{MA}_n$ can be used where $\\pmb{M}$ is a transition matrix and $\\pmb{A}n$ is a column vector containing two terms, one for adding a $c$ residue and one for adding an $h$ residue.
