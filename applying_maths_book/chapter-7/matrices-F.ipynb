    "### Polarisers\n",
    "Using the polarization properties of light can lead to a very sensitive method of detecting spectroscopic features. If light is linearly polarized, its electric field oscillates in one plane only, which is perpendicular to the direction the light travels in. This is shown in Figure 45, where the polarization is in the x-z plane, and this plane is defined as 'vertical'. Horizontally polarized light would have its electric field in the y-z plane. Light can be linearly polarized at any other angle, perhaps $45^\\text{o}$, in which case it would have equal components of the horizontal and vertical. Any amplitude of vertical and horizontal linear polarizations can be added vectorially to make linear polarization at any other angle. In this sense, vertical polarization is the addition of vertical with a zero horizontal component and vice versa.\n",
    "In the most general case, components in the y- and x-directions have a phase difference between them. When the phase lag is zero, linear polarization results; when $\\pm 90^\\text{o}$, right and left circular polarization results and the electric field rotates about the direction of travel, see Figure 2.7. Linear polarized light is a special case of elliptical polarization. The description of polarisation states is quite technical and elliptical polarized light somewhat difficult to visualize properly; however, by accepting that such polarization exists, the matrix methods to calculate the complicated changes caused by wave-plates and polarizers are surprisingly simple.\n",
    "In a typical experiment, a sample is placed between two crossed polarizers the second of which is adjusted usually to $90^\\text{o}$ compared to the first to extinguish any light passing through the first polarizer and the sample. If a small perturbation is now made to the sample, such as exciting it with a second laser or applying an electric or magnetic field, then its optical properties can be changed. Some light now leaks through the second polarizer and is detected; the amount of light is related to the perturbation and hence can convey some information about the molecules in the sample. The scheme is shown in Figure 46. This is a zero-background type of experiment, fluorescence is another, and because no signal is seen before the perturbation occurs, all zero-background types of experiments are very sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The polarizers could be made from sheets of Polaroid, such as in sunglasses. However, far better ones are made from the transparent and birefringent mineral calcite (CaCO$_3$). The crystal is cut at a certain angle and then made into two similarly shaped prisms or wedges, which, when placed at right angles to one another, form a cube. Variations of these polarizers are called Glan-Thomson or Glan-laser and when crossed only allow 1 part in $\\approx 10^6$ of the initial radiation to be passed. A Glan-Thomson polarizer set to pass vertical polarized light rejects horizontally polarized light by total internal reflection at the internal surface of the wedge, and vice versa. The angle to some fixed axis, say the vertical, is sometimes called the 'pass-plane' or 'vibration plane' of the polarized radiation. The effect is illustrated in Fig. 47 where the matrices describing the polarization are also shown as an inset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second type of polarizing element is a wave-plate, which causes the polarization state to be changed but does not change the light intensity. The polarization can be changed either from linear to linear with its axis rotated, or changed from linear to circular, or to elliptical polarization and vice versa. The direction that the major axis of the polarization ellipse has to the vertical is often called the fast axis; this is because wave-plates are made of birefringent crystals that have different refractive indices in different directions, and hence light has different speeds. Although one axis is called 'fast', the other is 'normal'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties of the polarized light and polarizing, dichroic, or birefringent optical elements can be analysed very easily by matrix methods. Although light or electromagnetic radiation generally can have a vast range of frequencies, and can travel in any direction, it has only two fundamental polarization states. These are manifested by the properties of the electric field of the radiation, which is always perpendicular to the direction of travel. Any polarizing state can be generated from randomly polarized radiation using only two types of optical elements; these are the linear polarizer and the wave-plate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with arbitrarily polarized light, such as sunshine, which has its electric vector randomly changing and so takes up any angle, passing it through a polarizer produces linear polarized light. If this light is then passed through a wave-plate, depending on the type of wave-plate and the direction of its polarization axis either the linear polarization is rotated, or it becomes circularly polarized. In the most general case, elliptically polarized light results, again with the major axis is a direction determined by the wave-plate used. Some examples of this effect are given in Fig. 48.\n",

    "The fundamental nature of light can be considered to be one of the two circular polarized states, left and right. To allow analysis of any polarization states, two types of algebra have been developed; these are the Jones and Mueller matrices. We shall concentrate on the Jones matrices. Gerrard & Burch (1975) describe the Mueller matrices, which are more appropriate for partially polarized light. The state of the electric field is represented as a _Maxwell column_; equation 27 shows equivalent forms of this\n",

This is most important; working with the _amplitude_ allows us to calculate correctly the effect of the phase. If we were to work only with the intensity then effects based on phase differences would not be correct.\n",

    "Linear polarized light is a linear combination of two circular polarization states but with zero phase difference between them ($\\Delta = 0$), consequently the orientation of its electric vector lies in one plane only and this may take any angle compared to the lab y-axis. The vectors representing linear polarization with unity amplitude in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively $\\displaystyle V=\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}, H=\\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$ because $\\psi=0$ and $\\delta=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearly polarized light can be formed at $\\phi = 45^\\text{o}$ to the vertical and is then described by the normalized vector $\\displaystyle L_{45}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\1 \\end{bmatrix}$ which has equal components in the vertical and horizontal directions.

In elliptically and circularly polarized light, the electric field spirals either clockwise or anticlockwise about the direction of travel."

The amount of retardation is set by the optical properties of the wave-plate's material. Crystalline quartz and calcite are both birefringent materials and therefore each has two refractive indices, an 'ordinary' and an 'extraordinary' one. The crystal has to be oriented and then cut so that the two refractive indices are directed at right angles to one another in the face of the wave-plate. Depending upon the rotation angle that the crystal presents to the incoming light, different amounts of these two refractive indices are used to change the incoming light. One polarization is always delayed with respect to the other in a wave-plate, because the speed of light at a given wavelength is different for the two polarizations because their refractive indices are different.
