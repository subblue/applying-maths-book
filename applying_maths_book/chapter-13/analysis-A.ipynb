This formula produces an unbiased estimate of $s$, but note that some authors define the standard deviation by dividing by $n$ rather than $n - 1$; there is not a single definition of $s$; see Barlow (1989, p. 11). The standard deviation is one of a class of measures called _dispersion indices_ ; range, quantile, skew, and kurtosis (peakedness) are others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, the formula for s says 'for each of the n measurements, subtract the average $\\langle x\\rangle$ from each $x$ value, square the result and then add up all the answers. Next, divide by the total number of measurements less one and finally take the square root'.\n",

This has a mean $\\mu$, called the _population mean_ , and its standard deviation is $\\sigma$; Greek letters being reserved for parent quantities, then this parent distribution is what an infinite number of ideal experimental results would produce. This ideal distribution is assumed to be the normal (Gaussian) distribution, see Figs 3 and 4. (The other common distribution is the Poisson, figure 13 which approximates the normal when its mean is $\\approx 10$ or greater.) The sample mean $\\langle x \\rangle$ is more likely than not to be different to the population mean $\\mu$.

Each parameter that is defined is considered to impose a restraint on the data and is, roughly speaking, equivalent to removing one data point. The more parameters that are measured the fewer data points there are left to describe the data (Parratt 1971).\n",

The Hadamard transform method, Chapter 9, enables the experimenter to measure in groups and the noise can then be reduced more rapidly than $N$.\n",

    "## 2 Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ are used assuming that data is distributed normally. But many quantities measured are not expected to have a normal distribution; for example, when counting photons or particles, a Poisson distribution is produced which is quite unlike a normal distribution at small $\\mu$, see figure 13. The speed of a molecule follows a Maxwell - Boltzmann distribution (see chapter 3 Q54), which is clearly skewed or lopsided, again quite unlike a normal distribution. However, remarkably, if several measurements are taken of a given velocity, their distribution will be normal. This is what the central limit theorem predicts and although easy to demonstrate, it is harder to prove. It states that by taking many similar measurements from (almost) any type of continuous distribution, the result always approaches a normal (Gaussian) distribution. This population distribution has the theoretical form\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the mean of the distribution and $\\sigma$ the standard deviation. The central limit theorem forms the basis by which the standard deviation of a normal distribution is used to characterize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning put more technically is that the sample mean $\\langle x\\rangle$, although an unbiased estimate, is unlikely to be exactly equal to the true population mean $\\mu$ and is itself subject to random variation. By repeating the sampling process, i.e. by repeating the whole set of measurements, a number of different estimates of $\\langle x\\rangle$ are obtained which are distributed about the true value $\\mu$. To simulate this and illustrate the central limit theorem, suppose that there are five measurements A, B, C, D, and E and each is an experimental result with values $1, 2, 3, 4$, and $5$ respectively. Any other numbers could be used but these are easy to average. The distribution of the numbers is uniform as shown in figure 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that randomly selected pairs of these values are taken making $2$5 possible samples. The pairs are shown on the left of the table and the corresponding average (sample mean) is shown on the right. Looking at this table there are five entries with a value of $3$, and only $1$ entry each with a value of $1$ or $5$. If plotted as a histogram, this begins to look a little like a normal distribution; figure 2.\n",

The random numbers are chosen from a uniform, i.e. flat, distribution between zero and one. Five samples are taken each time and the process repeated five thousand times; see figure 3 for the result. It can be seen that the sample averages that form the histogram are more closely clustered about the population mean and are therefore less variable than the original data. It can be shown that the variation in the mean, which is the uncertainty in the mean, equals the variation in $\\langle x\\rangle$ divided by the sample size,  $\\sigma^2/n$. With this in mind the normal distribution plotted on top of the histogram of the data is\n",

    "To solve this problem, a slightly different approach has to be taken and this involves using a common approach to testing data by forming hypotheses. This means testing whether or not there is confidence in a given mean value. Some criterion or test statistic is computed and used to make a decision. When using these tests, it is always assumed that the underlying parent distribution is normal and that the samples are independent of one another. Two related statistics are needed. When the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is known (it is $1/2$ in the problem), the following statistic can be used;\n",

The problem is to find critical values with which to test, with a certain confidence, how approximate the statement $\\langle x\\rangle\\approx \\mu_0$ actually is. For example, if $z_0$ is greater than $\\pm 1.96$ then with $95$% certainty $\\langle x\\rangle\\ne \\mu_0$; however, we would still expect to observe $\\langle x\\rangle\\approx \\mu_0$ on $5$% of occasions.

However, the number of samples is small and this last calculation assumes that many measurements have been taken. The statistic would be more discriminating if a second test were used based on the $t$ distribution.

As $t_0$ is less than this and $z_0$ is less than $1.96$, although this is a less critical test, the conclusion reached is that with $95$% confidence the data is consistent with a population mean of $50$ and standard deviation of $1/2$ and the lab is up to standard.\n",

The two means are only samples from the true distribution and should not be very different from one another as they are supposedly measuring the same thing. The difference in means should therefore be normally distributed about the true difference $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$, which in turn, should be zero. The simplest test is to use the propagation of errors formula, see Section 4, to compare the difference in the means $\\langle x\\rangle_1-\\langle x\\rangle_2$ with the difference in standard deviation,\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes data points seem to be too far from the trend exhibited by all the others and there is then a temptation to remove such points. This must always be resisted. One famous consequence of removing data led to the hole in the Antarctic ozone layer being missed. As the New Scientist (31 March 1988) put it, 'So unexpected was the hole, that for several years computers analyzing ozone data had systematically thrown out the readings that should have pointed to its growth.' However, it should be remembered that by the random statistical nature of noise adding to any measurement that deviations, often large ones, are to be expected. Note also that the process of smoothing data is akin to removing outliers and should be avoided, and in some settings, clinical ones for example, no data should ever be disregarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Chebychev**\n",
    "When outlying points are found in data, the obvious thing is to check that no numerical or transcriptional error has occurred, then go to the instrument used and check that a simple error has not been made, such as using the wrong solvent or a mistake in the concentration, or amplifier setting and so forth. The instrument could be checked out with a known reference but if everything turns out satisfactorily then it must be assumed that the data point is the result of random chance. Highly unlikely but not impossible. If the experiment cannot be repeated and the data still has to be dealt with, then the Chebychev rule may be useful. \n",

The value of $k \\gt 1$ is for us to choose. The data described above in Section 3.4 for the $^{12}$C / $^{14}$N ratio has a mean of $50.22$ and a (sample) standard deviation of $s = 0.466$. If $k = 2$ is chosen then $1 - 1/4 = 0.75$ or $75$% of the values should fall in the range $50.22 \\pm 2 \\cdot 0.466$.

    "## 3.7 Standard deviation in a single measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "When only a single measurement has been made, as is often the case in an undergraduate laboratory, the question arises as to what standard deviation it should be given. In such laboratories, many other measurements will undoubtedly have been made so the mean and standard deviation for the experiment will be known. However, in the absence of such knowledge we can appeal to the Poisson distribution (see Section 6.4) to determine what value should be given to the standard deviation. It turns out that by calculating the maximum likelihood function that the standard deviation is the square root of the result itself. Thus if the result has a value $k$ then $\\sigma_k =\\sqrt{k}$.\n",

    "## 3.8 Weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 1.9.13 the average energy and average length of trans and gauche butane molecules was calculated by weighting the individual values according to the Boltzmann distribution. Experimental measurements are similarly not always of equal precision and this may be inherent in the nature of the observation. When counting photons, for instance, the precision of each measurement is proportional to the number of counts. For example, the intensity of an emission spectrum varies with wavelength; the precision is therefore different at different wavelengths. Alternatively, it may be that one instrument has twice the resolution of another or simply it may be that one experimentalist is better than another; nevertheless, the average has to be taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "If two measurements of $x$ are made and $x_1$ is twice as precise as $x_2$, then the weighted average is made in the proportions, $\\langle x\\rangle = (2x_1 + x_2)/3$. In the general case, if $w_i$ are the weights, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\langle x\\rangle=\\frac{\\sum\\limits_i w_ix_i}{\\sum\\limits_i w_i} \\qquad\\tag{18}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation means that the contribution of each measurement to the average is in proportion to $w$ unweighted measurements. This formula has been used in several other guises in other chapters to estimate an expectation value, when $w_i$ was called the distribution of $x_i$ rather than a weighting. The weighted standard deviation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum\\limits_iw_i\\left(x_i-\\langle x\\rangle\\right)^2}{\\sum\\limits_iw_i} }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For experimental measurements, weighting is optimal if it is the reciprocal of the variance, $w_i=1/\\sigma_i^2$ and $\\sigma_i$ must be determined for each of the $i$ observations. In many cases the $\\sigma$ will be equal to one another, then  $\\displaystyle \\langle x \\rangle =\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_ix_i$, which is the unweighted mean of $x$. The variance of the weighted average is\n",

    "### **(v) Spectral lines**\n",
    "Suppose that on one instrument a line in the SO$_2$ infrared spectrum is measured at $550\\;\\mathrm{ cm^{-1}}$ with a standard deviation of $\\sigma = 10\\;\\mathrm{ cm^{-1}}$; another instrument is then used with $\\sigma = 5\\;\\mathrm{ cm^{-1}}$ and produces $555\\;\\mathrm{ cm^{-1}}$. The unweighted average is $552.5\\;\\mathrm{ cm^{-1}}$, while the weighted average of the two measurements is $554\\;\\mathrm{ cm^{-1}}$, which is close to that of the higher resolution instrument as might be anticipated. \n",
    "\n",
    "If three measurements are made of a rate constant with values $(3.16 \\pm 0.03)\\cdot 10^7, (3.21 \\pm 0.05)\\cdot 10^7$, and $(3.14 \\pm 0.02)\\cdot 10^7\\;\\mathrm{ s^{-1}}$, the errors are then taken to be the standard deviations and equations 18,19 are used. The best combined rate constant is $(3.15_2 \\pm 0.014)\\cdot 10^7\\;\\mathrm{ s^{-1}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many experiments, the standard deviation can be found by looking at an instrument's specification, where a resolution of a certain number of wavenumbers or millivolts, and so forth, is usually given. In other cases this may have to be estimated from the data itself and this can be difficult to do point by point. However, one case in which the standard deviation is known exactly is in a particle or photon counting experiment because the arrival of photons at the detector is Poisson distributed where $\\sigma^2 = \\mu$ and then $w_i = 1/\\mu_i$ where $\\mu_i$ is the average number of counts in the $i^{th}$ measurement. Fluorimeters often use photon counting to measure fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra, and the standard deviation can then be measure directly from the data.\n",

    "## 4 Error propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "In many experimental situations, a measurement does not always produce the final result, which will be obtained from further calculations, and may also involve other experimental measurements. For example, the measured value and its associated error may have to be exponentiated and then multiplied by another quantity with its error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for error propagation (or combination) can be determined by expanding the required function as a Taylor series about its mean value and substituting the result into the variance equation 3; see Bevington & Robinson (2003) or Barlow (1989) for the proof.

    "The variance and mean have been used in our calculations on the assumption that they were the 'best estimation' of these properties, which means that they are as close as possible to the true values for the underlying process given that only a limited number of measurements are taken. Using the Maximum Likelihood method these estimates, such as mean and variance, can be found in terms of the measured values which we call $x_i$.\n",

    "A series of measurements of the same thing will always have a probability distribution $f(x,\\theta)$ with measured values $x_1,x_2\\cdots$ and the distribution will always depend on some unknown parameter $\\theta$, for example it could be the the mean. The likelihood function of observing a series of events is therefore the product of individual events, viz, $L(\\theta) = f(x_1,\\theta) f(x_2,\\theta) f(x_3,\\theta)\\cdots f(x_n,\\theta)$. What we want to know is what quantity best describes the quantity $\\theta$, i.e what is the most likely value of this quantity.  This can be found by differentiating $L$ with respect to this quantity which is often the mean or variance, then setting the value to zero in the usual way of finding a maximum.\n",
