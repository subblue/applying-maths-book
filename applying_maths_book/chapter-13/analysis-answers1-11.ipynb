    "at the $95$ % confidence level. Since the confidence on the intercept is slightly smaller than the intercept itself, this does not cover zero at $95$% confidence, so it can be assumed that there is a small systematic error on the angle. The fit is acceptable as it is clear from the data that $x$ has a strong effect on $y$. This is confirmed by the $F_0$ statistic from the ANOVA test which is $1685$ and greatly exceeds the statistic from the $F$ - distribution at the $99$% level which is $f (0.01, 1, n - 2) = 8.86$.\n",

    "(a) The P branch occurs below about $2880\\;\\mathrm{ cm^{-1} }$and the R branch above this. The first P line is the $J'' = 1 \\to J' = 0$ transition and is at $\\approx 2860\\;\\mathrm{ cm^{-1} }$ and the first R branch line $J''=0\\to j'=1$ is at $\\approx 2900\\;\\mathrm{ cm^{-1} }$. The lines converge in the R branch and diverge in the P because the average bond length is greater in the upper vibrational level than in the lower one.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) The double lines are due to the presence of the two isotopes of chlorine, 35 and 37. This is confirmed because the less intense line is always at smaller wavenumber than the more intense one and is in a constant ratio. If the lines are due to two different types of molecules and not isotopes, it is most unlikely that the vibrational frequency could be almost the same. However, given that this has occurred, the spectrum is then most likely to be more symmetrical, that is the less intense lines would be at smaller wavenumber one side of the spectrum and longer on the other or vice versa because the two molecules would have different bond lengths and hence rotational constants. Additionally, the very small spacing between each pair of lines would be expected to differ across the spectrum because two different molecules are unlikely to have exactly the same shaped potential.\n",
