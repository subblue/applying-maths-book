    "## 6.1 Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations, the purpose of an investigation is to obtain an equation (regression model) that can be used to predict the value of one variable by knowledge of others. Probably the most useful and most applied method of doing this is the _least squares_ method. The basic idea is shown in figure 7, where the square of the $y$ displacement from the line to each data point, is minimized. The minimization is only along $y$ because it is assumed that the $x$ values are known exactly. By minimizing these displacements with an assumed model of the data, a straight line for example, the best fit to the data is obtained, and the calculation produces the slope and intercept of the best fitting line. Furthermore, the 'goodness' of fit can be made quantitative, allowing different theoretical models that might describe the data to be compared with one another. Different sets of data can also be compared. The least squares is a parametric method because a (parameterised) function is fitted to data, there are non-parametric methods, such as principal component analysis (section 13) that seek to understand the data without knowing the functional form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that in a chemical reaction the product yield is proportional to the pressure. Using the limited number of measurements available, it would be appropriate to calculate a least squares fit to the data to predict the yield that is most likely to occur at any given pressure. This information could then be used to control the reaction in some form of feedback loop. Similarly, if in a reaction the concentration of a compound vs time is measured, this can then be analysed using a least squares method to obtain the rate constant. Taking this further, if the rate constants vs temperature are measured, then an Arrhenius plot can be made and, by a second least squares analysis, the activation energy obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the least squares method is extremely useful and universally used, there are some pitfalls to avoid. A straight line can be fitted to any set of data; it is only a matter of how well the line fits and whether this fit is acceptable. Several statistical tests can be used to check this. Fitting is not restricted to straight lines, and quadratic or higher polynomials can be used, as can exponentials or sine and cosines. The function used should always be based on the underlying science. Any set of data could fit equally well to several different functions and the more complicated the function, a polynomial or sum of several exponentials for example, the larger the number of variable parameters will be and the better the fit is going to be. Hence the quip, 'with enough parameters you can fit the shape of an elephant'. However, the fit may describe the data but have no relationship at all to the underlying science, in which case nothing has been achieved because the parameters obtained have no meaning.\n",

    "Figure 7. The displacements are assumed to be Gaussian distributed. The line is $Y$, the experimental points, $y_i$. The square of all the displacements is minimized.\n",
    "__________\n",
    "\n",
    "Another pitfall is to make false correlation between observables. The reading age of children shows a very good linear relationship to their shoe size, but to suggest that a child with large shoes must be good at reading is clearly nonsense. The obvious correlation is that older children are generally better at reading than younger ones. A less obvious relationship is found in the rate of the rotational diffusion $D$ of molecules in the same solvent. This can be measured by observing a molecule's fluorescence through polarizers. A good linear correlation is found between D and the reciprocal of the molecular mass. This is, however, false. The true correlation is with molecular volume $V$, which for a limited class of molecules, such as aromatics or dye molecules, has a similar proportionality to mass. The Stokes - Einstein equation $D = k_BT/(6\\eta V)$, where $\\eta$ is the viscosity, shows that molecular volume is the important quantity. The $D$ vs reciprocal mass correlation can now easily be tested; an iodo-derivative has a far greater mass but not much greater volume than the protonated molecule. Remember that a strong observed correlation between the variables does not imply a causal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final thing to look out for when using least squares is outliers. These are data points well away from the trend indicated by other points. It may be argued that these can be ignored as being due to faulty experimentation, but if this is not the case these points have to be dealt with and in Section 3.6 such a test was described. The least squares method is inherently very sensitive to these points, because the square of the deviation is used. It is often quite clear that the line does not fit the data and is pulled away from what one would expect to see as the fit; see figure 15. In this case, a more robust method such as _least absolute deviation_ is required, Section 6.8, without removing data points.\n",

    "Suppose that the straight line\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle Y=a_0 +b_0x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is proposed to describe the data. In a least squares analysis, the test is to determine whether the experimental data y follows the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle y_i =a_0 +b_0x_i +\\epsilon_i, \\quad i=1,2,\\cdots n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is a random error with a mean of zero and standard deviation of $\\sigma$. The least squares method produces the best constants $a_0$ and $b_0$ that describe the data, in the sense that the $Y$ values calculated are the most probable values of the observations. This is based on the assumption that the data are Gaussian (normally) distributed as is expected to be the case from the central limit theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the least squares method does is to minimize the square of the displacement between the values calculated from a 'model' function and the experimental data points $y$. Figure 7 shows the displacement for one point and a Gaussian distribution from which that point could have been produced. The statistic used to assess the goodness of fit is called 'chi squared' $\\chi^2$ and is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\chi^2=\\sum_{i=1}^nw_i(y_i-Y_i)^2\\qquad\\tag{25}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y$ is the experimental data, $Y$ the model set of estimated data, and $w$ the weighting. The ideal weighting is $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2$ . The $\\chi^2$ forms a distribution and the chance that a certain value can be obtained is calculated in a similar way as for the normal or $t$ distributions, see Section 5.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis that the deviation of each experimental data point from its true mean value is normally distributed, the probability of observing the $y_i$ data points is the product of individual normal distributions, which can be written as\n",

    "($h=1/\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2}$) The most likely values are obtained when this probability is at its maximum, and this is found when $\\sum_{i=1}^nw_i(y_i-Y_i)^2$ has a minimum. This is the same as minimizing the $\\chi^2$ therefore this is used as a measure of the 'goodness of fit' of the model function to the data. The minimum $\\chi^2$ is found by differentiating this with respect to each of the parameters in the model function. This approach is quite general and is called a Maximum Likelihood method.\n",
    "\n",

    "Generally speaking if $Q>0.001$ the model is acceptable, and although this seems rather lax, if the model is wrong $Q$ will be _orders of magnitude_ smaller.  Experience shows that several a good 'rule of thumb' is that the reduced chi square is units or equivalently $\\chi^2\\approx df$. Prest et al. 1986 (Chapter 14 Numerical Recipes) has a detailed discussion on chi squared fitting. One important point is that this test of goodness of fit is very useful when the weighting for the data is not known, because the $\\chi^2 $ cannot then be used quantitatively. \n",

A 'run' occurs when consecutive residuals have the same sign, which is unlikely to occur if they are random. Therefore, if the data is random, then there are an equal number of small runs of positive and of negative numbers.\n",

The plot is of residuals vs. the experimental $y$ value. The points should be randomly distributed about zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good model will produce a small residual (error) variance and if there are two or more competing models then the model with the smallest error variance should be chosen. The variance of the slope and intercept are calculated by expressing the respective equations as functions of $y_i$ (the experimental data) and using the law of propagation (combination) of errors. The gradient is the ratio $b = S_{xy} /S_{xx}$ and only the numerator depends on $y_i$. Using the relationships\n",

The covariance for the data used above is $-5\\cdot10^{-4}$ which is very small. When several parameters are being estimated such as in a polynomial or nonlinear, least squares calculation then the covariance between pairs of parameters should be examined and is often reported as a matrix of value.

Prediction lines can be constructed to project confidence limits past the data and these lines are slightly wider than the confidence lines. The prediction lines are produced by replacing $1/S_w$ by $1 + 1/S_w$ in equation 42. This takes into account the error from the model and that associated with future observations. The two sets of curves are almost identical with the particular set of data used in figure 8.\n",

    "\n",
    "The correlation coefficient $R$ is often listed among the parameters when a spreadsheet or graphing package is used to analyse a straight line fit. It represents the proportion of the variation (information) in $y$ that can be accounted for by its relationship with $x$. However, in the physical and many of the biological sciences, this is a not a useful quantity and _should be avoided_ as a measure of how well a straight line describes the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that what would be considered as a good fit has a correlation coefficient of, for example, $R = 0.99$ and a poor fit perhaps a value of $0.98$, which is so similar that it provides very poor discrimination between good and bad fits. This poor discrimination is illustrated if larger and larger random numbers are added to the data and the least squares fitting repeated until $R$ decreases slightly to $0.98$. However, the reduced $\\chi^2$ has now increased to $\\approx 8$ i.e. by about ten times, instead of being $\\approx 1$, indicating that now, with the added random values, the model is a very poor fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $R$ is the sample correlation coefficient then $0 \\lt R \\lt 1$ and is defined as $R = b\\sqrt{S_{xx} /S_{yy}}$ and\n",
    "as the $S_{xx}$ and $S_{yy}$ depend only on the data points, the ratio is a constant multiplied by the gradient $b$ and this is why it is a poor statistic. The constant part is the 'spread' of the $x$ values divided by that of the $y$."

    "\n",
    "After completing an experiment you will have data that describes the effect that you are examining. You should also have a model/hypothesis that produces an equation that describes the same effect. We will suppose, for simplicity, that you need a linear least squares fit to your data to obtain the parameters in your model.  \n",

    "A basic undergraduate experiment is to use a spectrophotometer to measure the optical density of a series of solutions of known concentration to form a calibration curve, and then to determine an unknown concentration. The calibration curve has the simple form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle D_\\lambda=\\epsilon_\\lambda[C]\\ell$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D_\\lambda$ is the optical density, at wavelength $\\lambda$, $\\epsilon_\\lambda$ the extinction coefficient,  $\\ell$ the sample path length and $[C]$ the concentration, thus the gradient is $\\epsilon_\\lambda \\ell$. A second example is the Stern_Volmer equation, which describes the relative fluorescence yield as a result of quenching at quencher concentration $[Q]$. (See Chapter 10, Q10 and Q8 of this Chapter). This equation has the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\varphi}{\\varphi_0}=1+K[Q]\\tag{42 a}$$\n",

    "The fluorescence yield is $\\varphi$ at quencher concentration $[Q]$, $\\varphi_0$ the yield without quencher and $K$ the Stern-Volmer constant. This equation can also be written equivalently as\n",

    "and so has the simpler mathematical form $y=bx$. The question remains, however, should these data be analysed using either $y=bx$ or $y=a+bx$ even though theoretically $a=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is always to use $y = a+bx$ for the simple reason that any experimental measurement always contains some noise and that noise has a distribution of values. Of course there is also the additional possibility of some bias has crept into the measurement such as an unexpected and systematic error. Additionally experiment measures what actually happens and the equation, from theory, used may not adequately describe this. For all of these reasons it is always best for linear least-squares to use $y=a+bx$. The Stern-Volmer equation should therefore be used as eqn. 42a with the expectation that $a=1\\pm \\sigma$, where the error in the intercept can be analysed to see if it is within what is expected at, say, a $95$% level. If it is not, and the error in the gradient is also large then one may suspect that the model used does not describe the data or that some other unexpected error is involved. If eqn. $42b$ has been used then such important information is lost and the analysis may seem correct but is misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of analysing data described as $y=5+10x$ is shown below, where normally distributed noise is added. The results of a typical fit shown in. fig 9a (left). You can see that in this particular case the gradient of the $a+bx$ fit is slightly less than the true value while that for $y=bx$ is too large. After $1000$ similar trials a histogram of the least squares gradient is plotted for both cases, fig. 9a (right). It is clear that while both sets of data produce a distribution of gradients, only the plot of $y=a+bx$ produces, on average, the correct gradient as shown by the vertical line at $b=10$. The distribution of gradients is a gaussian whose width is proportional to the standard deviation of the slope. \n",
    "\n",
    "These plots also illustrate that although the least squares gives the best fit to the data, this is usually slightly different to the true value, which is entirely to be expected given the nature of the noise, i.e. the noise always has a distribution and this is reflected in the distribution of results obtained. These distributions also illustrate the necessity of repeated measurements, for only by repeated measurements can the true value be approached. Of course, the true value might be obtained by chance with the first measurement, however, you will not know that this is the case.\n",

The blue dashed line is the fit to the same data points using $y=a+bx$ and the red dashed line using $y=bx$. Right. This plot shows histograms of the gradients for the two fitting functions after $1000$ calculations. The vertical line at $b=10$ shows the true gradient. The gray dotted lines show the (average) standard deviation of the slope, $b\\pm\\sigma$ for the fits making up the histogram and has a value of $\\approx 0.56$\n",

    "## Over-parameterising\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a note on over-parameterising the fit. If we use $y=a+bx$ perhaps $y=a+bx+cx^2$ might be better? The way to check this is to observe the fitted data using this non-linear function starting from different initial values. If the data is actually a straight line then the parameters $b$ and $c$ compensate for one another, i.e. lots of pairs of $b,c$ will give practically identical fits and thus similar overall error and a similar error to the linear fit. Of course the context is important here, there has to be a reason based on the science to use a different fitting function, otherwise all one is doing is smoothing the data with an arbitrary function."
