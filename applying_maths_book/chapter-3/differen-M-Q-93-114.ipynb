    "## Q95 Flux and diffusion\n",
    "A flux $J$ is defined as the amount of substance passing through an area $A$ of a solution in time $t$, and is $J = dn/dt$, which means that $dn$ molecules pass through the area in time $dt$. In a solution of constant temperature, if you do not stir it, this flux is due only to the diffusion of the molecules. If there is no concentration gradient, then clearly the solution has a uniform concentration and the flux from bottom to top through a victim area $A$ is the same as top to bottom, making zero in total. If you make a concentration gradient, for example by heaping two teaspoons of sugar in the bottom of a cup of coffee, then the flux of the sugar one way through our victim area $A$ is greater than the reverse; diffusion acts to equalize the concentration and thus the concentration depends on time $t$ and position in the solution $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one dimension, the flux is related to Fick's first law of diffusion as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle J=-D\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $c$ the concentration at position $x$, and the flux $J$ is therefore now defined in units of $\\mathrm{mol\\,dm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$. Clearly, the flux is greatest when the concentration gradient is greatest. Partial derivative notation $\\partial$ is used because the concentration depends on position and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Diffusion in one dimension may be supposed to be that down a thin, smooth-walled capillary whose length $x$ is far greater than its diameter. In this case the rate of change of concentration is $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}=-\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}$. Differentiate $J$ and so find Fick's second law.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Fick's second law can be solved by realizing that the flux $J$ must be zero at the closed ends of our capillary tube; this is the boundary condition, and the resulting concentration is given by\n",

Plot the concentration as a function of distance $-x \\to x$ and at different times when $D = 2.5 \\cdot 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{ m^2 s^{-1}}$, which is approximately that of water, and assume that $c_0 = 1\\,\\mathrm{ mol\\, dm^{-3}}$.

The heat capacity at constant pressure $C_p$ is the rate of change of enthalpy with temperature and that at constant volume, $C_V$, is the rate of change of internal energy with temperature.

    "(b) Calculate this energy for 1 mole of CO$_2$ expanding from $10 \\to 20 \\,\\mathrm{dm^3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** It is not obvious where to start but the internal energy $U$ is given either by $H = U + pV$ or $A = U - TS$. Differentiation with respect to $V$ at constant $T$ is required, so the second equation describing the Helmholtz free energy $A$ should be tried. Recall that $A$, $U$, and $S$ are each functions of $V$ and $T$. The equation $dA = -SdT - pdV$ is also needed. The van der Waals equation is $(p + n^2a/V^2)(V - nb) = nRT$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $a$ and $b$ are constants, and for the calculation in (b) the value of each constant should be looked up in a textbook such as McQuarrie & Simon (1997).\n",

    "(b) the total energy of the van-der-Waal's gas, which is its internal plus kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** The internal energy of an ideal gas is zero but it still has kinetic energy. An ideal monatomic gas has energy $3nk_BT/2$, where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant. A term $nk_BT/2$ is added for each degree of freedom in the molecule, one for its kinetic energy in three dimensions, or equivalently each squared term in the energy, potential and kinetic. Therefore a diatomic gas has an extra $nk_BT2/s$ each for potential and kinetic energy because the bond stretching energy varies in proportion to the square of the extension. In (a) the Maxwell equation $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial V}  \\right)_T=\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial T}  \\right)_V$ is required.

    "In solving the quantum mechanical problem of particle on a ring or the two-dimensional rigid rotor (see Chapter 10.5.9), and in the solution of differential equations such as two-dimensional diffusion or vibrations of a membrane, the conversion of derivatives from Cartesian to plane polar or cylindrical coordinates is necessary. The equations require the derivatives $\\partial z/\\partial x$ and $\\partial^2 z/\\partial x^2$ to be found in terms of $r$ and $\\theta$ using the conversion from rectilinear to cylindrical coordinates; $x=r\\cos(\\theta),\\;y=r\\sin(\\theta),\\;z=z$ and $r^2 =x^2 +y^2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first derivative calculation is very easy, the second very tough!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** (a) Use the chain rule to find $\\partial z/\\partial x$ by expanding this as a total derivative in terms of $r$ and $\\theta$. Then differentiate again. To find derivatives such as $\\partial r/\\partial x$ the equations must be rearranged so that there are none with mixed coordinates on the same side of the equation, thus to find $\\partial r/\\partial x$ start with $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, differentiate and then simplify. In the second derivative calculation, you will need to recall that that $r$ and $\\theta$ are only functions of $x$ and $y$."
