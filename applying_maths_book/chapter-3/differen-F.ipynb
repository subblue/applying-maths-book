    "## 6  l' Hopital's rule\n",
    "In many calculations limits are encountered. For example, in the theory of diffraction the function $\\sin(x)/x$ is met which, when $x \\to 0$, has the form $0/0$ and at first sight this ratio seem to be indeterminate. There are other forms similar to this such as $\\infty/\\infty,\\, \\infty/0,\\, 0\\times \\infty,\\, 0\\times 0,\\, \\infty-\\infty$ and l'Hopital's rule is a method, sometimes used with a little additional ingenuity, of determining these limits. This topic is discussed here, not only because it requires differentiation, but also because it will be needed in the next section. It seems that Johann Bernoulli first worked this out, but it is named after l'Hopital who was one of his pupils.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Rearrange the limit required, if necessary, so that it becomes a ratio. This may require some cunning.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Differentiate top and bottom separately with respect to the limit variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Substitute in the limit and check if the ratio is still indeterminate. If it is return to (b) if not the answer has been found.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example should make this clearer; the ratio $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$ appears to be $0/0$ as $x \\to  0$ but it has a finite value which is determined using l'Hopital's Rule:\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle  \\lim_{x\\to o} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\to \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}\\sin(x)}{\\frac{d}{dx}x}=\\frac{\\cos(x)}{1}=1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the limiting value of $x = 0$ is only applied in the last step. As a check, one way to determine any limits close to zero is to plot the function. You will see that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$ does indeed have a value of 1 at $x = 0$. See question 47 for other examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions such as $\\displaystyle \\frac{e^x-1}{x^2}$ often need to be evaluated when $x \\to 0$ or $x \\to \\infty$.

    "\n",
    "One very useful property of derivatives is that they allow us to find the maxima and minima of functions; these are also called stationary points of the function. The extrema might be the maximum or minimum but can also be the limit where the function goes to $\\pm \\infty$.\n",

    "The maximum of a curve is a point in whose locality all surrounding points have smaller $y$ values. The minimum is defined similarly but points adjacent to it have larger y values and in both case the gradient is exactly zero. In Fig. 12 it is clear that the gradient is zero at the maximum and again at the minimum of the curve. The graph shows the first $f'$ and second $f''$ derivatives. An inflexion point can occur when the gradient is zero but $y$ is smaller on one side of the point than it is on the other. An inflexion can also occur when the gradient is not zero in which case the curvature of the line changes from concave to convex or vice versa.\n",

The first derivative is $y' = 6(x - 3)(x - 4/3)$, which has roots at $x = 4/3$ and $3$, which from the graph (left) are the maximum and minimum.

    "\n",
    "Many compounds such as ZnS-Cu and zinc silicates-Mn and many other crystalline minerals, will show phosphorescence lasting many tens of seconds after excitation with UV light. Some phosphors also show luminescence on heating and this provides a method of dating minerals and clays directly or in man-made objects discovered by archaeologists after being buried perhaps for millenia. The cause of the luminescence is the recombination of electrons, liberated by the UV or heat (i.e. as phonons) from relatively low energy impurity 'traps'. The excess energy is released as a photon. These impurity traps have an energy between the filled levels (ground state or valence band) and the empty ones at higher energy (excited state or conduction band). \n",
    "\n",
    "In ceramics heating during firing the clay releases all the previously trapped electrons and effectively sets the clock to zero. Subsequently the compounds in the ceramic are continuously energised via the breakdown of radioactive elements in their environment the total amount growing with the amount of time they are buried. After millenia there are enough trapped electrons to produce a measureable amount of phosphorescence when the material is either exposed to strong light, often a few seconds exposure to daylight is sufficient, or heated. The time-range of this method is from approximately $2000 \\to 350,000$ years ago.\n",

At very high temperatures all the electrons have enough energy to reach a trap and no more are left to luminesce and so again the intensity is zero.  This is important when this method is used to date pottery or other artefacts because heating sets the 'clock back to zero' by allowing all electrons to recombine with traps.

    "## 8 The Calculus of Variations. The Euler-Lagrange Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider finding the shortest distance between two points on the earth's surface or finding the equation giving the minimum area of a surface, or the curve of fastest descent between two points. The Calculus of Variations allows us to work out solutions to problems of this type  where the function describing the solution has to go through a starting and ending point and also has the restraint, usually, of being the minimum distance, area or energy (Arkfen 1970, Boas 1983). In addition the this calculus uses the Euler-Lagrange equation which usually how these types of problems are solved and is invaluable in the study of mechanics as it allows Newtons Laws of Motion to be applied to many interesting situations that are otherwise very hard to solve (Susskind 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine a graph that shows the many possible different curves that will fit between any two points. A practical example would be all the different routes by which you could fly from e.g, Paris to Sydney. Each one slightly different from all others but we want to find the one having the minimum path-length. This is obviously trivial on a flat surface as the straight line is shortest but it is not obvious on a sphere. The Calculus of Variations is so named because finds a function that results from varying a path by an amount $\\delta y$ and, as the variation, $\\delta y \\to 0$, the path along $y$ becomes the same as that along $y + \\delta y$. Because the whole path is sought, the problem is to find a function $f$ that, provided it exists, will make an *integral have a stationary* value, also called an *extremal*, which usually means that it has the smallest possible value. This as yet unknown function is one of a infinite number that could satisfy the integral but by imposing that condition that makes the integral unchanging, i.e. stationary, the function is found. This is written in general terms as\n",

You may need to consult Chapter 4 (integration) to complete the last step in this type of problem. "

These bodies could be a planet and its moon, a sun and a planet or two atoms/ions attracted by an electrostatic potential. In each case the force attracting them together, such as gravity,  does not depend on the angle only their separation and is called a *central force*.  If there was only this force then a planet and its moon would have collided long ago, there has to be angular motion as well, i.e. angular momentum in the two bodies to prevent collision and to keep them orbiting about one another.

An asteroid or comet with positive $V_{eff}$ would still be attracted to a planet but eventually be repelled by the centrifugal barrier and never form a stable orbit. If the angular momentum is not large enough a collision will occur because here the centrifugal barrier moves towards zero distance, effectively at the surface of the heavier mass.\n",

    "#### **Circular orbit at minimum energy $E_{min}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the body is exactly at the minimum of the potential, recalling that it must also have angular momentum it follows an  exactly circular path about the origin (the Sun for example) with angular velocity $\\displaystyle \\dot\\varphi =\\frac{\\mathbb L}{mr_{min}^2}$. \n",

    "\n",
    "If the energy is above the minimum but less than zero, as happens to planets in our solar system, each will follow an elliptical orbit round the Sun. The Sun is at one focal point of the ellipse. The elliptical motion  is understood by realising that above the minimum energy there are two turning points on the orbit that have the same energy, i.e. there is a maximum and a minimum separation $r$, see fig 14b. All radii in-between these have the same energy. This can only occur in a stable orbit if this is elliptical which means that the distance from a sun varies periodically with time, which in turn means that, although the total energy is constant, there is a periodic exchange between kinetic and potential energy. One way of understanding how this results from fig 14b is to recall that this shows all the motion around the orbit projected into one graph, i.e. all $\\varphi$ values are shown together. Thus all the distance between the minimum at $r_0$ to the maximum $r_1$ are shown together as a line. Clearly, each radius must be ever so slightly different from the one present a moment earlier and so on so that smooth motion of the planet results. In this case only an ellipse describes the motion. \n",

    "The Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe made careful measurements of the motion of the planets before the age of telescopes. In 1609 his assistant Johannes Kepler put these measurements to good use and described how the planets moved. He did not understand why they moved as they did, this was before Newton discovered his laws of motion and law of gravity, but he did get the facts correct.\n",

    "**K3** The square of the orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the radius of its orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these laws may be explained by Newtons Laws of motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "**K1** We have seen how the effective potential predicts elliptical orbits when the energy is above the minimum and less than zero. The circular orbit at the minimum is thus a limiting case. \n",
    "\n",
    "**K2** It is clear that for a circular orbit where the planet moves at constant speed (angular velocity) that equal areas must be swept out in equal time, but it is not so obvious for an ellipse. However, it turns out that Kepler's second law is equivalent to a statement of the conservation of angular momentum which means the shape of the orbit, as long as it repeats itself, does not matter. To calculate the area a small angle from a the radius vector $r$ is taken so that $\\varphi\\to \\varphi +\\delta\\varphi$ and the area of the resulting triangle calculated, see fig 14c. \n",
