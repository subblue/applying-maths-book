To differentiate the equation using the formal equation is harder than following the rule 'differentiate the outside and then the inside', but can be done. Suppose that $f = (a + x^2)^3$ is to be differentiated with respect to $x$. Letting $x=h$ and $u=1+x^2$ gives $du/dx=2x$ and as $f=u^3$,then $df/du = 3(u)^2$ and the result is $df/du = 6x(1 + x^2)^2$.\n",

The left-hand side is expanded to give the right, rather than starting with an explicit function, of say, $S$ in terms of $T$ and $p$. The functional form does exist but it is not needed for us to be able to write down the expression; the fact that it exists is enough for further calculations. The reason for using this approach is that the change of entropy $S$ with pressure can be converted into a measurement of entropy with temperature, and a measurement of the change of temperature with pressure. The entropy change with temperature can be accurately measured with an electrochemical cell.\n",

The $p$ subscript indicates constant pressure, but we will drop this now for clarity.

For example, $\\displaystyle \\sin(y) + x^2e^x = 1$, and cannot easily be put into the form $y = \\cdots$. In this case implicit differentiation is necessary, which is just a grand sounding name for a rather simple procedure and one with which you are already familiar.

    "  Sometimes it is easier to describe equations in parametric form as two functions with a common or dummy variable, rather than in the conventional way; there is no fundamental reason for doing so, just convenience. An example is the equation of a circle. If it has a radius a and is centred at the origin,\n",

    "The parametric equations of an ellipse are $x = a \\cos(t), y = b\\sin(t)$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants that define the axes of the ellipse. When they are the same, a circle results. The equation of a parabola is $\\displaystyle y^2 = 4ax$; in parametric form this can be written as $x = at^2$ and $y = 2at$.\n",

    "#### Calculating the Parametric Equation\n",

    "As an example consider finding the parametric equations of an epicycloid. This is the curve formed when one disc rotates about another, such as two coins. In the (false) models of the solar system, such as proposed by Ptolemy, epicycloids were used to describe the motion of the planets. Initially these worked quite well but as time passes such models, based as they were on incorrect physics, became increasingly inaccurate.  If the epicycloid curve produced has one cusp it is called a cardioid due to its heart-like shape, those with two cusps are called nephroids after the shape of a kidney. Figure 6a shows two epicycloids, the number of cusps corresponds to the ratio of radii.\n",

    "Assuming that the fixed circle is centred at the origin of the coordinates (fig. 6b), the parameter $t$ used in the parametric equations is the angle from the x-axis to the centre of the rolling circle as shown in figure 6b.  The aim is to represent the point D in terms of the angle $t$ and the radii of the two circles $r_a\\;r_b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by writing down the lengths AB and BC which are $x_{AB}=(r_a+r_B)\\cos(t)$ and $y_{BC}=(r_a+r_B)\\sin(t)$. This leaves the horizontal distance from D to B to be found, and the similar vertical distance D to C. This means finding the angle DCB ($\\theta$). We know that the angle ACB is $\\pi/2 - t$ because ABC is a right angled triangle. To find the other angle we realise that the distance $L$ from the contact point P of the two circles to point O and to point D is the same, since one curve rolls over the other. The angle $t$ is equal to the same fraction of the circle as distance O to P ($L$) is to the circumference; similarly angle ACD to length PD which is also $L$. Thus $\\displaystyle \\frac{t}{2\\pi}= \\frac{L}{2\\pi r_a}$ and for the angle ACD $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi/2-t+\\theta}{2\\pi}=\\frac{L}{2\\pi r_b}$. Equating the two lengths $L$ and a little rearranging gives $\\displaystyle \\theta= \\left(\\frac{r_a+r_b}{r_b}  \\right)t+\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The extra $x$ length is then $\\displaystyle-r_b\\cos\\left(\\frac{r_a+r_b}{r_b}  t\\right)$ and the parametric equations are \n",

    "Finally, if there are two similar coins and if one rotates (without slipping) half way round the other what direction will it now point compared to that initially? The answer is that it will point in the same direction as that when it started. The distance travelled is $\\pi r_a$ which is a rotation by 180<sup>o</sup> but there is also the rotation added by the fixed coin making $360^\\text{o}$ in total.\n",

    "\n",
    "To differentiate any vector, each of its elements is treated separately. In the previous section, we saw how to represent a curve in parametric form. The two parametric equations can also be represented in vector form; for example, a parabola is represented by the equation $y^2 = 4ax$, but in parametric form this can be written as $\\displaystyle x = at^2$ and $y = 2at$ and in row vector form as $\\displaystyle t = [x y] \\equiv [at^2 2at]$.

Previously, equation (23), it was shown that the gradient was the ratio of the derivative of $y(t)$ over that of $x(t)$. Applying this produces $\\displaystyle \\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{2a}{2at}=\\frac{1}{t}$ so that the gradient is $\\sqrt{a/x}$ which is the same as starting with $\\displaystyle y^2=4ax$.\n",
