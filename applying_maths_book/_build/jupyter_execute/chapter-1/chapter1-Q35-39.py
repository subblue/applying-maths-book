# ### Q35 Rounding and errors
# Rewrite and/or correct the following in the most appropriate form.
# 
# $$\begin{array}{l|l|l}
# 5.6789 \times 10^{-7} \,\pm 4 \times 10^{-9}\, \mathrm{kg} & 1.2345 \times 10^4 Â± 3\, \mathrm{m/s} & 2312.128 \pm 0.01 \,\mathrm{cm^{-1} }\\
# 30.01\, \mathrm{mm} \pm 0.001\, \mathrm{cm} & 3.45 \pm 0.6564 \,\mathrm{Tesla} & 19.67346 \pm 1.57\, \mathrm{kJ/mole} \\
# 9.36156 \pm 0.312 \,\mathrm{kJ/mole} & 123.34 \pm 20 \,\mathrm{K} & 101352 \pm 133.322 \,\mathrm{N\,m^{-2}}
# \end{array}$$
# 
# ### Q36 Significant figures
# Record the results of the following calculations to an appropriate number of significant figures.
# 
# $$\begin{align}
# 30 + 2.167 &= \\
# 3.0004/12.2 &= \\
# \log(1.001) &=\\
# \end{align}$$
# 
# ### Q37 SI units
# Convert voltage, resistance, and capacitance into base SI units.
# 
# ### Q38 Folding paper
# (a) If a piece of paper is 0.1 mm thick, how many times will it have to be folded to reach the moon?
# This is hardly realistic, nevertheless, suppose that it were possible.
# 
# (b) Graphene is a one carbon thick layer of atoms with the structure of graphite having sp$^2$ hybridized C-C bonds forming six membered rings. If a sheet of graphene were folded for the same number of times as the paper, how thick would it be?
# 
# ### Q39 Heat of evaporation
# In natural history programmes, it is common to see pictures of dried up lakes due to intense heat and lack of rainfall.
# 
# (a) Calculate how much energy is needed to evaporate the last one inch depth of each $1 \mathrm{ km}^2$ of a lake.
# 
# (b) How many full car petrol tanks contain this much energy?
# 
# (c) If the solar irradiance is $1.3\, \mathrm{kw/m^2}$ how long will it take the sun to evaporate the same volume of water assuming all the incident energy is used to do this?
# 
# (d) The water evaporating from the lake will rise, cool and condense into a cloud as it meets colder air. Why do clouds float when they contain so much water?
