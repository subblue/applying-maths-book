    "\n",
    "When you learn mathematics, it is normal to use $x$ and $y$ to do most of the algebraic manipulations. In science, $x$ and $y$ are almost never used and this simple change can make a simple equation look complicated. This is something that you just have to get used to, but is made easier if you think what the variables mean; then perhaps you will be confident, say, to differentiate with respect to temperature $T$ rather than feeling that this can only be done with variable $x$. How ingrained using $x$ and $y$ are, is not, however, to be underestimated, for even experienced practitioners will on occasion revert to these when faced with a difficult calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one fundamental rule for manipulating an equation and that is to make sure that whatever is done to one side is done to the other. The equality$^1$ sign = means that the left-hand side of any equation is always equal to the right; for example the ideal gas law equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle pV = nRT \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "means that the product of pressure $p$ and volume $V$ is always equal to the number of moles multiplied by the gas constant $R$ and the temperature $T$. To isolate the pressure on the left-hand side, both sides of the equation must be divided by the volume,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{pV}{V} = \\frac{nRT}{V}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is then canceled through on the left giving $p = nRT/V$. To avoid making mistakes, the best approach is to do any manipulations step by step even if they seem trivial. Repeating a calculation because a slip has been made in an earlier step takes far longer than it does being thorough at each stage.\n",

    "### 1.2 Multiplication and division\n",
    "\n",
    "Slightly different notations are used when mathematics is written by hand, printed in a book, or interpreted by a computer language. One instance is the different symbols used to indicate multiplication; for example, multiplying together three quantities can be written as $pqr,\\; p \\times q \\times r,\\; p \\cdot q \\cdot r$ or $p. q. r$. In the last two examples, the point could be confused with a decimal point if numbers were involved of if vectors as the dot product, see chapter 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most computer languages, including Python used in this text, multiplication is indicated by the symbol, *, for example, $\\mathtt{a*b}$. Raising a number to a power is written as $\\mathtt{p**3}$ or $\\mathtt{p**(1/3)}$  for the cube root.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the brackets (), {}, [ ]  are each used to indicate multiplication, and if an equation dictates that brackets must be nested then different ones may be used for clarity. In a computer language, different brackets are usually used to indicate _different types_ of arrays or functions, but exactly which is used depends on the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each term inside a bracket, is multiplied by any terms outside; for example in mathematical notation, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle a(b - c) = ab - ac \\quad \\text{and}\\quad (a - d)(b - c) = ab - ac - db + dc$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "If a bracketed expression is multiplied by itself then this is written as, for example, $(a-d)^2 =(a-d)(a-d)=a^2 - 2ad  + d^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python and other languages, $a(b - c)$ would be written as $\\mathtt{a*(b - c)}$. The reason for the multiplication sign is that one or more letters, such as $a$, followed by a bracket could indicate a function, array, vector, or matrix. Which one depends on how the name, in this case, $a$, was defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In printed equations, division is sometimes ambiguous because it is not clear what is to be divided; for example, $a/bc$ can mean $\\displaystyle \\frac{a}{bc}$ or $\\displaystyle \\frac{a}{b} c$, which is $(a/b)c$; it depends on the convention being used as to which operation takes precedence. The safest way, although a little clumsy, is to write $a/(bc)$, making it clear that $a$ is divided by $bc$. In Python and other computer languages, $a/b*c$ means $(a/b)*c$, so adding brackets is essential to get the calculation you expect."

    "### 1.3 Approximation: never do this in the middle of a calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncating numbers in  the middle of a calculation is an easy way to introduce numerical errors, the final result only should be rounded and if it related to an experimental value then the extent of this will be determined by the standard deviation or uncertainty in the value. In some calculations a similar type of approximation can be made algebraically, but this is also risky.   \n",

Suppose that $x$ is small compared to  $1$ then $x^2$ is very small and $x^3$ tiny, then it is possible to approximate $\\displaystyle e^{-x} \\approx 1 - x$ and this is valid.

    "### 1.4 Assignments in Python and other computer languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python when something has to be calculated, it can be typed directly for example, $\\mathtt{2.5*6}$; or $\\mathtt{np.sin( np.pi/6 )}$ where the prefix $\\mathtt{np.}$ tells Python to use the numpy numerical library. (This has to be loaded initially, see the header to this page or the appendix on using Python ). The result can be see by printing to the screen as $\\mathtt{print(np.sin( np.pi/6 ) )}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the result is needed later on, then the calculation must be assigned a name. This name could be almost anything but is usually a letter and numbers, $\\mathtt{f01,\\, result3}$ and so forth, but not a name such as $sin,\\, log$ etc. as these are reserved names.  The assignment operation is the equal symbol = , so, $\\mathtt{thesine= np.sin(np.pi/6)}$ would produce $\\mathrm{\\sin(\\pi/6)}$ every time $\\mathtt{thesine}$ is typed; thus, $\\mathtt{6*thesine}$ is the same as $\\mathrm{6 \\sin(\\pi /6)}$. The assignment does not produce an equation; it makes the _name_ on the left of the = sign produce the calculation shown on the right. Thus a statement such as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\mathtt{eqn1 = x**2 + 3*x - 2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is acceptable but not $\\mathtt{eqn1 = x**2 + 3*x = 2}$.  Details of Python syntax are given at the end of the book. Because many different symbols are used in maths, and some only infrequently, these are listed in the Glossary with their meanings, also at the end of the book\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation $y = 1/x$ may be written in functional form as $f(x) = 1/x$, thus, if $x = 2$ the function has the value of 1/2, or $f(2) = 1/2$. The function operates on its argument $x$, which here is $2$, to produce its reciprocal. The $x$ in the function, either as its argument or in the body of the function is, however, simply a symbol, and is arbitrary; it is the algebraic expression or operation itself that determines what happens. Therefore, writing $f(w) = 1/w$ is entirely the same as $f(x) = 1/x$; if a function is evaluated with a series of numbers then it does not matter whether $w$ or $x$ was used to represent the mathematical operation; the result is the same. Similarly, as $x$ is only symbolic, it is possible to write a composite function where the argument is itself a function; e.g. $f (x^2) = 1/x^2$ or $f (e^x) = 1/e^x$, which means that the function $f$ _operates_ on $x^2$ or $e^x$ to produce its reciprocal. Formally, this would be written as $f[g(x)] = 1/g(x)$ where $g(x)$ is the 'inside' function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can consider a function to be a _rule_ that converts $x$ or $w$, or whatever symbol is convenient to use, into some other mathematical form. You can also consider it as a _mapping_ that transforms $x$ into a new form. The function 'log' follows the rules to make the log of a number, and is written as $f(x) = \\ln(x)$, and formally the range $x \\ge 0$ should be added, but usually this is assumed to be known. A different example is illustrated by the functions used to find the real and imaginary part of a complex number. Complex numbers $z$ have two parts; the 'real' and the 'imaginary', which is multiplied by $i =\\sqrt{-1}$; for example, $z = 2 + 3i$, see Chapter 2. The real function is written $f(z) = Re(z)$ and the imaginary function $f (z) = Im(z)$ and if $z = 2 + 3i$ then $Re(z) = 2$ and $Im(z) = 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some functions are 'even' and others 'odd', many are neither. 'Even' functions have the property that they do not change sign when their argument changes sign, $f(x) = f (-x)$, but 'odd' functions do change sign $f (x) = -f(-x)$; $x^2$ is an even, $x^3$ an odd function. A function's odd or even properties are very useful in evaluating integrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse functions also exist, which means that if a function $f(x)$ changes $x$ to something else then the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ changes it back. Suppose that the function $T_F$ changes temperature in degrees centigrade ($^{\\text{o}}$C) to Fahrenheit ($^{\\text{o}}$F), $T_F(C) = 9C/5 + 32$; the inverse, $T_C$, takes $^{\\text{o}}$F and converts it into $^{\\text{o}}$C as $T_C(F) = 5(F - 32)/9$. This last function could be written as $T_F^{-1}$(F) because it is the inverse function. Finding the inverse function can be quite involved and is described in Section 1.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, a function transforms its argument into some other mathematical object, which can be of almost every possible type. The principle is the same whether the function produces the reciprocal, or square or an integral or a series and so forth. The function may also be called a transform, an operator, or a mapping of the argument ($x$) onto some other object.\n"

Starting with a known set of initial conditions, an algorithm proceeds to some other known set of conditions that ends the process and does so in a finite number of steps. A game could be considered to follow an algorithm in that it follows a fixed set of rules and starts and ends in a definite way. An algorithm could be the sequence of operations undergone to determine the rotation, reflection, and other symmetry properties of a molecule, or it could simply be the steps producing an algebraic or numerical calculation. This leads to a more restrictive and more common definition of an algorithm as a series of instruction with which to perform a calculation on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.8 Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "So familiar are numbers and counting that we hardly give them much thought and automatically use different types of numbers and ways of counting as the situation dictates. Integer numbers are either prime, when the number is only divisible by itself and 1, or composite and the product of two other integers. Besides the positive and negative integers, there are the rational numbers or fractions, generated from their ratios, $n/m$, such as $1/2,\\, 2/3$, etc. A fraction is called proper when the numerator is less than the denominator, $2/3$ for instance, and a fraction improper if the numerator is greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to express fractions as decimal expansions such as $0.500$, or $1.36348 \\cdots$ etc., which are called real numbers. In some countries, real numbers are expressed with a comma $0,500$ or $1,36348$ instead of a decimal point, and the comma is the international system of units (SI) recommended symbol, although it is never used in the English-speaking world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fractions, such as $98/77$, there are repeats of the sequence of digits; this fraction has a $2$ digit repeat and is $1.272727 \\cdots$ while $98/78 = 1.256410256410 \\cdots$ has a 6 digit repeat. The irrational fractions can also be expanded in decimal notation, $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142135 \\cdots$ , however, the sequence of digits does not repeat itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decimal numbers, as the name implies, use a base of $10$ for counting, however, we are also quite happy using other counting systems; base $60$ to count time, with $60$ seconds in a minute and $60$ minutes in an hour, as well as base $12$ or $24$ for counting the hours. Angles such as latitude and longitude, essential for navigation, are based on the $360^\\text{o}$ of a circle with the degrees each split into $60$ minutes and then into $60$ seconds of arc. Engineers used to use _grads_, which divide the circle into $400$ parts, and perhaps some still do. In measuring weights, the old Imperial units, pounds (lb) and ounces (oz), where $16$ oz = $1$ lb and $14$ lb = $1$ stone are still used, although this is being replaced by the decimal units based kg and g. Distances in the UK and in North America are measured in miles, an arbitrary measure of $5280$ ft, based on a yard of $3$ ft with each foot containing $12$ inches, although the km, m, and cm are replacing these older measurements. Eight km is approximately $5$ miles and $1$ inch $\\equiv 25.4$ mm. A distance of $3$ yards, $1$ ft and $4$ inches is often written as $3,\\, 1'\\, 4''$ and a similar notation used for degrees, minutes, and seconds of arc, $25^\\text{o}\\, 12''\\, 3''$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because computers are now so fast in performing calculations, it is almost never necessary to write code at the binary level, which is base two. Binary means calculating at the bit and byte level; the numbers used are $0$ and $1$ only. In octal, numbers based on $0$ to $7$ only are used and in hexadecimal numbers are on base $16$. These are chosen by convention to have the numbers and letters, $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F$. Thus $10$ in decimal is $A$ in hexadecimal, $15$ in decimal is $F$ in hex and $16$ in decimal is $10$, pronounced as '1 zero', in hex. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not difficult to do arithmetic in hexadecimal, just awkward because we are so used to decimals and often change to decimal to do the calculation and convert back, this being easier than learning the hexadecimal multiplication table. Hexadecimal arithmetic is used only rarely now as programming a computer is usually done at a high level. Once 'hex' was necessary not only to get speed in a calculation on a computer using words $16$ bits wide, but also to 'talk' to an external instrument via pulses generated by repeatedly sending a $1$ or $0$ to a certain address that is then mapped onto the pins of an output socket on the computer. The table shows a comparison of different number systems in the order top to bottom, decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary. In section 10 describing modulo arithmetic an algorithm for converting from decimal to other bases is described.\n",

    "\n",
    "Integers are the numbers that are colloquially called whole numbers, $-2, 0, 3$, etc. and they extend from minus infinity to plus infinity; $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ and although there is an infinity of them they are what mathematicians call countable. Integers are clearly not the only numbers as we are familiar with the real numbers such as $1.2,\\, 3.56$, and so on, of which there is also an infinite number, but many, many more than there are integers. If two different real numbers are chosen, an infinite number of others can be squeezed in between them simply by adding more decimal places; this and other interesting discussions on numbers and algorithms are explained clearly in 'The Emperor's New Mind' (R.Penrose publ. 1990 Vintage OUP). Surprisingly, real numbers can usually be reduced to a rational fraction which is a ratio of two integers, e.g. $0.751 = 326/533$, but, for some numbers, $\\pi,\\, e, \\sqrt{2}$ there is no ratio of integers that will accurately form the number and they are called _irrational_, i.e. not being logical! You may recall that $\\pi \\approx 22/7$ , which would seem to contradict this statement, but $22/7$ is a very poor approximation to $\\pi$, only accurate to three digits, $355/113$ is better but only to seven digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a computer to perform calculations, a distinction is made whether a real or integer number is used. This is a common feature of programming languages and also in computer algebra, for example, the integer division $2//3$ is exact and in Python (notice the //), it remains in the calculation as such. In other languages integer division can result in the answer $2/3 = 0$ rather than $0.666^.$ or remaining as an exact ratio so this has to be checked carefully.\n",

    "\n",
    "Whole books have been devoted to the number $\\pi \\approx 3.1415926$, such as The Joy of Pi (Blatner 1999), and calculations performed to study the pattern of its digits, which now extend to many thousands of millions of decimal places. As far as is known, the pattern of digits does not repeat itself; if they did it would mean that $\\pi$ could be written as a fraction of two whole numbers and would no longer be an irrational number. $\\pi$ is also a transcendental number, which is one that is not the solution (we say root) of any polynomial equation, and it is not considered to be algebraic; it transcends algebra and this guarantees that it is irrational.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximations to $\\pi$ are $22/7,\\; 355/113, \\; 52163/16604$ and many others.

    "$\\pi$ appears naturally in many algebraic formulae that have no obvious geometric interpretation. Some estimations involve summing series, others dropping needles across a square grid (Buffon, 1707-1788), and yet others, going back at least to Archimedes, measure either the length of one polygon that is just larger, or one that is just smaller, than a circle. The proof of this method is very elegant and leads us in a direction that is not obvious before coming to its conclusion. We shall follow it through and then write an algorithm with which to calculate $\\pi$. We consider ourselves to be advanced and modern, but looking at the subtlety in this and other proofs, we soon realize how brilliant were those who initially worked them out.\n",

    "To calculate $\\pi$, the idea is first to draw a circle and then place a square inside this touching its circumference. Next, a pentagon, hexagon, and 'n-agons' are drawn in the same way, and as the number of sides gets larger, the closer the straight-sided polygon will get to the circumference of the circle. And, if another polygon is drawn just outside the circle, then the two values of the polygons' circumferences define upper and lower bounds to the value of $\\pi$. However, actually drawing these polygons on a piece of paper, or the computer, is not necessary as geometry and algebra can be used. This was how the first calculation of an accurate value of $\\pi$ was achieved, and furthermore, to 15 decimal places, and was described by the Iranian astronomer Jamshid al-Kashi in 1424 in his book 'A Treatise on the Circumference'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation starts by sketching a hexagon in the circle, then a 12-sided figure (a dodecagon). Just one segment of each is shown in Figure 1. The drawing need not be very accurate and only represents the shapes. Geometry is used to assert their true shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 shows the straight edge of one piece of the hexagon, DB = $a_1$ and a dodecagon CB = $a_2$. The plan al-Kashi had was to find $a_1$ and then to determine $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$ and then continue to a '24-gon' and find the length of one of its segments, calling this $a_3$, which is known in terms of $a_2$ and so on. By adding up the lengths of polygons with more and more sides, better and better estimates of $\\pi$ are obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been known since the time of Euclid, that for a triangle drawn in a circle the angle at the centre of a circle is twice that at the circumference; therefore, if $\\angle$ DAB is $\\theta$, then $\\angle$ DOB is $2\\theta$. An angle at the centre and circumference is shown in Figure 2:\n",

You may also notice in Figure 1 that AD is parallel to OC, that $\\angle$ADO is also $\\theta$ and that OC and DB are at right angles since the arc DC = CB and therefore OC bisects DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can start the calculation of $\\pi$. Remember that we have to find $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$. To find $a_1$ we have to find the length of one side of a hexagon, BD. But in a hexagon, the total length of the six sides is easily found since each segment, such as ODB is an equilateral triangle, $2\\theta = 60^\\text{o}$, and if the circle has a radius of $1$, then OA and OB = $1$, since OC, OD and BD $\\equiv a_1$ thus, $a_1 =1$.\n",

    "His method was to find a relationship between $x_1$ (which is AD) and $x_2$ (AC), and use this to find $a_2$ (CB) knowing that $a_1 = 1$ and to repeat this process for polygons with progressively larger numbers of sides. To find $a_2$, two lines CZ and OY, are drawn that are, respectively, perpendicular to AB and AD as shown in Figure 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "The square root is familiar as the solution to an equation such as $n^2 = 3$. The square root is also the length of the diagonal of a square or rectangle and therefore has a geometric interpretation. The Pythagoreans discovered that the length of the diagonal of a square of unit side, i.e. length one, is $\\sqrt{2}$; see Figure 4. Although it is hard to imagine this today, this calculation caused a scandal since this number was not 'pure' in the sense that it was not the ratio of two whole numbers. And the scandal still echoes down the centuries. Numbers that are not the ratio of two whole numbers are called irrational or 'un-ratio-able', the Latin word ratio coming from the Greek for 'logo' which means ratio. We use the word logic to symbolize reason and it is still a pejorative statement to describe someone as being irrational.\n",

    "The right-angled triangle does not of itself produce the value of $\\sqrt{2}$ very accurately, since the length of the line would have to be measured; it is more of a geometrical definition. The first calculation of a square root was made by the Babylonians (modern-day Iraqis), about four thousand years ago, and is inscribed in a clay tablet preserved at Yale University. A geometric method was used that could be converted into an algorithm. The result on the tablet was accurate to five decimal places and the calculation shows the Babylonians knew Pythagoras's theorem about a century before Pythagoras discovered it. This result is remarkable, and it is possible that a formula was used similar to what is now called Heron's method after the Alexandrian mathematician and engineer who lived about two thousand years ago; his dates vary from $150 \\to 250 AD.\n",

First order processes occur in the radioactive decay of atoms, the decay of molecular and atomic excited states, such as by fluorescence, and in dissociation and cis/trans isomerisation of molecules.\n",

This will become the decay rate constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of no reaction in the short time interval $\\Delta t$ is $1-p=1-k\\Delta t$. If it survives this interval the probability of surviving the next interval is also $1-k\\Delta t$ and so by the law of probabilities, the chance of surviving both intervals is the product $(1-k\\Delta t)^2$ and so for $n$ such intervals the probability is $(1-k\\Delta t)^n$. The total time is the sum of all time intervals, $t=n\\Delta t$ and by substituting gives $(1-kt/n)^n$. \n",

    "Even for a single molecule the probability of remaining unreacted can extend to infinity. In practice this is only a matter of sensitivity in an experiment. In time-resolved, single-photon counting, used to measure the decay by fluorescence of an excited state, the decay is routinely measured down to 5 orders of magnitude, transient absorption decay, remarkably, has been followed to at least 9 orders of magnitude decrease in intensity and 13 orders in time. But eventually either, no matter how many times the experiment is repeated or, how many molecules we start with the noise inherent in the experiment will dominate and we can go no further. Thus if the decay has a rate constant of 1/nanosecond the chance of waiting even as short a time as a microsecond without it decaying first is tiny, $p=e^{-10^{-6}\\cdot 10^9}\\approx 10^{-435}$! This is of course why we say that first order reactions come to a halt after a certain time, the chance of observing becomes so small any signal is lost in noise and, even if we started with a mole's worth of molecules, the probability of remaining unreacted is $\\approx 10^{-435+23}$ which is still utterly minute."

However, care is needed because if your pressures are in Torr ($750$ torr =$1$ bar) then the conversion will be needed. As an example if the pressure is in torr and $K_P=2$ then $\\Delta G=-RT\\ln(2)$ but as we work in SI units with $RT$ then so must be the pressure producing $\\displaystyle -RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{750}\\frac{\\text{bar}}{1\\, \\text{bar}}\\right)$."
