    "An important example is found in the CAS registry number, which is used to uniquely identify every chemical compound.  There are at least 35 million compounds known, so uniqueness is important. The last digit in the CAS number is a check digit, used to confirm the uniqueness of the number. The check digit is obtained by multiplying each preceding digit by its position in the number; taken in reverse order, starting by multiplying the last digit by $1$, the second to last by $2$, etc. then adding the result and calculating modulo $10$ of the number produced. The CAS number for naphthalene is $(91 - 20 -3)$; the $3$ is the check digit. This is obtained with the following sum, $0 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 3 + 9 \\times 4 = 43 $ and finally, $43 \\text{ mod } 10 = 3$, where the $3$ is the remainder of a whole number of divisions of $10$ into $43$.\n",

The next octave, above or below, has exactly the same ratio of frequencies and so follows modulo $12$ arithmetic. \n",

We use modulo arithmetic and start with the decimal and cut it into parts. We have to use integer division which mean whole number division and ignoring any fractional value, thus $3//2 = 1$ where $//$ means integer division. In comparison $ 3 \\text{ mod } 2 = 1$ which is the remainder.\n",

Further properties of this function are described in Chapter 9.

    "### 13 Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating quantities is sometimes relatively easy to do and can often be used to help design experiments. An accurate number is not sought; just an order of magnitude estimate is often sufficient. A straightforward example is to estimate the minimum useful concentration of a sample knowing the sensitivity of an instrument. This can be put the other way around. At the maximum allowable sample concentration, we can estimate what the size of the signal will be and whether the method proposed will work or whether another more sensitive instrument should be used. Other forms of estimation can be used to obtain quantities that would otherwise seem impossible, such as calculating the weight of a mountain or the weight of the atmosphere. In these types of problems, we make some simplifying, but not unreasonable assumptions to be able to reach a sensible conclusion; the mountain could reasonably be approximated by a cone or a hemisphere depending on its shape. Several interesting estimation examples are given by Adam (2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **X-rays**\n",
    "In an X-ray experiment on crystalline Be, suppose that the detector(e.g.a CCD type camera) can respond to single X-ray photons; estimate the least number of electrons that there must be in the crystal's scattering plane for a signal to be detected. What does this imply for the size of the crystal? (Assume that the scattering from $n$ electrons is $n$ times that from a single one and the following data is assumed to be known.)\n",
    "The fractional intensity, $I/I_0$, of X-ray scattering by a single electron is approximately given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{I}{I_0}= \\frac{e^4}{(4\\pi\\epsilon _0)^2m^2c^4}\\frac{1}{R^2}\\frac{(1+\\cos^2(\\phi))}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I_0 = 10^8$ is the initial number of X-ray photons per second, $R$ the distance from the centre of scattering to a detector, and $\\phi$ the angle through which the X-ray is scattered. The detector is $1$ m from the sample and at an angle $\\phi = 20^{\\mathrm{o}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, although calculating $I/I_0$ is straightforward it is not if you use a calculator because the powers produced are too large. The calculation is done by first adding the powers, then the remaining numbers are easily evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\begin{align}\\frac{I}{I_0}&=\\frac{(1.6\\cdot 10^{-19})^4}{(4\\pi \\cdot 8.8\\cdot 10^{-12})^2(9.1\\cdot 10^{-31})^2(3\\cdot 10^8)^4\\cdot 1  }\\left( \\frac{1.8}{2}  \\right)\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "If the initial X-ray intensity is $10^8$ photons/sec then $\\approx 10^{-21}$ X-rays are detected from each electron, which means that $10^{21}$ electrons have to be present to detect one X-ray. As Be contains four electrons, $(1/4) \\cdot 10^{21}$ atoms are needed, which is $10^{21}/(4 \\times 6 \\cdot 10^{23}) \\approx 4\\cdot 10^{-4}$ moles. The molar mass is $9$ g mol$^{-1}$, thus, to detect 1 photon/second, the sample has to weigh at least $0.0036$ g and as the density of Be is $1.8\\;\\mathrm{g\\; cm^{-3}}$ this is a cube of volume $0.0036/1.8$ cm$^3$ which has a side of $\\approx 0.13$ cm which is not large.\n",

To calculate the mass of the atmosphere would appear to be difficult because of the changing density with increasing altitude. However, if atmospheric pressure is taken at sea level to be $1\\; \\mathrm{atm} = 101325$ Pa all that is needed is the surface area of the earth and the fact that a pascal is a N m$^{-2}$ which is force/area. Assuming that the earth is a sphere of radius $6378$ km, its surface area is \n",

    "The atmospheric mass is therefore $\\approx 5.18 \\cdot 10^{19}/g = 5.27 \\cdot 10^{18}$ kg where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity $9.81$ m s$^{-2}$.\n",

    "#### **Benjamin Franklin and a pond**\n",
    "The American Benjamin Franklin is famously remembered for flying a kite with an attached wire into a thunderstorm in an attempt to capture lightning and store it in a Leyden jar (Bernal 1973). Luckily, he survived. He is less well known for changing the florid opening of the American Constitution to read 'We hold these truths to be self - evident, that all men are created equal'. He travelled to England in 1757 to help with the tax situation of Pennsylvanians, and while sailing noticed that oil on water calmed waves, something that had been noticed since the time of the Greeks. Being interested in surface phenomena, when again in London in 1770, he poured no more than a teaspoon of oil on a pond on Clapham Common and observed that the oil spread of its own volition over the pond, sweeping leaves and other debris out of the way as it did so. He estimated that the oil covered about half an acre of the pond ($2023\\;\\mathrm{m^2}$ ), and he repeated this experiment everywhere he went from then on. He also recorded seeing colours due to thin film interference effects but could not have explained this, nor could he have realized that a monolayer of molecules was formed because the idea of atoms and molecules was not clearly understood at that time. He appears not to have worked out the thickness of the oil layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the monolayer thickness, a teaspoon holds approximately 4.5 ml and half an acre is $2023\\;\\mathrm{ m^2}$. From the amount of oil used, the thickness of the layer was $4.5\\cdot 10^{-6}\\; \\mathrm{m}^3/2023\\; \\mathrm{m}^2 =2.2$ nm. This is approximately the thickness of a close-packed, one-molecule thick layer of a long chain fatty acid monolayer, and gives a simple and direct estimate of the length of the oil molecules used. Oleic acid is a major constituent of olive oil and is a by-product of making candles; it has an 18-carbon chain so when fully extended would be about 2.8 nm long, remarkably similar to our estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Size of atom**\n",
    "If the density of Li is $0.534\\,\\mathrm{ g\\, ml^{-1}}$, what is average size of an atom? A mole contains $6.022 \\cdot 10^{23}$ molecules, therefore $6.9$ g (the molar mass) contains this number of atoms occupying a volume\n",

    "or $2.18 \\cdot 10^{-2}\\, \\mathrm{nm}^3$. Assuming spherical atoms, each has a radius $0.17$ nm which is not a bad estimation considering the approximate nature of the calculation. The similar calculation for Pb produces $0.19$ nm."
