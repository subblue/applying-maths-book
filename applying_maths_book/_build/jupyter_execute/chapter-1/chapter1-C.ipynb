    "### Permutations, Combinations and Probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The branch of mathematics dealing with permutations, combinations, and probability is perhaps that most closely related to everyday experience, particularly so if you play cards or do the lottery. There are different ways of counting the number of the arrangements of objects, such as molecules or footballs and these are permutations and combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Permutations** \n",
    "Permutations count the number of ways of arranging objects so that each permutation is unique. This means that the order is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Combinations** \n",
    "Combinations count the number of ways of selecting objects from a group without considering the order of selecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall describe these quantities in terms of 'objects' and 'boxes' and let them variously apply to dice, playing cards, electrons, atoms, molecules, and energy levels as the context requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "In genetics, probabilities are used when calculating the outcome from mixing genes through the generations. In physical science, statistical mechanics uses ideas based on placing particles into energy levels and from their distribution, partition functions can be calculated which in turn lead to thermodynamic qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability or _chance_ of an event occurring, will be defined as the ratio of the number of successful outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, and can only have values from $0$ to $1$. It is implicitly assumed that any one event is just as likely to occur as any other. A particular outcome is not therefore predictable; only that a certain fraction of times the expected result will occur if many trials are carried out. For instance, you would not expect to be able to throw a die so that a $1$ is always produced. One might obtain a $1$ on the first throw. If a $1$ is obtained on the second throw, this is surprising, but if on a third, this suggests, but does not prove, that the die might be biased because we expect a die to produce a $1$, or any of its other numbers, _on average_ only once in six throws. Probability theory allows the calculation of the exact chance of each possible outcome without having to do the experiment. Because the probability or chance of a successful event $p$, cannot be greater than $1$, the chance of failure is $q = 1 - p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1 Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "A permutation is an _ordered_ arrangement of objects and if the order is changed then a new permutation is produced. The five letters A to E arranged as A B C D E form one permutation; A B C E D and A B E C D are others. If there are five objects then there are $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$ permutations. The proof is straightforward: the letter E can be put into five different positions. If D is now moved then it can be placed in four positions, C in three, and so forth; therefore, the number of permutations when all $n$ objects are chosen is $n(n - 1)(n - 2) \\cdots 1$ which is $n!$. This can easily be a truly vast number, but if there are only three objects then there are only 3! = 6 ways of doing this which are ABC, ACB, CAB, BAC, BCA, CBA. The permutation of $n$ objects is written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle P(n, n) = n!$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When only some of the objects are chosen, the permutations will be fewer. Suppose that either $p$ objects at a time are chosen out of $n$, or that $p$ objects are placed into $n$ boxes so that no more than one is in any box, then the number of ways of doing this _'p from n'_ calculation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle P(n, p) = n(n - 1)(n - 2) \\cdots (n - p + 1) =\\frac{n!}{(n-p)!}\\tag{19}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing any two letters, $p = 2$, from three, $n = 3$ produces 3!/1! = 6 permutations. For example, if the letters are ABC, then the six choices are AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, CB. Because each permutation is distinct, if we were to place them into groups or 'boxes' then only one arrangement goes into each box. When $n = p$, because $0! = 1$ this equation equals $P(n, n) = n!$. If each of the permutations is equally likely, then the probability of any one occurring is $1/P(n, p)$. Note also that the notation $P(n, p)$ is not universal and $_nP_p,\\; ^nP_p$ or $P_p^n$ are also commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.2 Permutation with groups of identical objects\n",
    "\n",
    "If some of the $n$ objects are identical then clearly the number of choices is going to be reduced. To take an extreme example, if all the objects are identical or indistinguishable from one another, then there is only one way of arranging them and the number of permutations is one. If there are $n$ objects split into two groups and each of $v$ and $w$ are identical objects, the number of permutations is reduced by dividing by the number of ways of separately arranging every identical group, and the result is $n!/(v!w!)$. If the $n$ objects are A A B B B E C D, then there are $8!/(2!3!) = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 2 $ ways of arranging them or 12 times less than if all the letters were distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The identical grouping permutation can be stated more formally as the number of ways of selecting $n$ objects if these are in $r\\; (\\le n)$ groups of $m_1, m_2, m_3 \\cdots m_r$ objects. The total of all $m_r$ objects must be $n$. The number of permutations with groups is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle P_G = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{i=1}^r m_i!}$$\n",

    "where the symbol $\\prod$ indicates the product. This number is also the number of ways of placing $n$ distinguishable objects into $r$ distinguishable boxes so that boxes contain $m_1,\\; m_2, \\;m_3 \\cdots m_i$ objects each, and each of the objects in any box is alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of ways of arranging the amino acid residues of even a small protein is astronomically large, but countable. An active protein in a bee's sting is called mellitin. It is a protein with only 26 amino acids and which forms two short $\\alpha$-helical regions, with a bend in between. Two such helices are seen in the crystal structure 2MLT.pdb in the RCSB data base (www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). \n",

    "ways of arranging a chain. Nature has had to search in the 'space' of all combinations to find an effective protein (one that causes pain when you are stung) and has had a very long time to do so. However, this number of permutations is still so large that even producing a different sequence at one a minute, supposing that this were possible, would have taken $\\approx 5 \\cdot 10^{15}$ years, which is far longer than the age of the Earth. This is, of course, a misleading calculation for two reasons at least. One is that it assumes that the protein always had $26$ amino acids whereas, in the distant past, it was probably far smaller but was nevertheless effective  enough  to give the bee's ancient ancestor an evolutionary advantage. Secondly, many permutations of even a few amino acids will not have the stability to form any structure other than a random coil and so could never exist as a functioning protein. Those that do form some stable structure and are effective are then preserved and passed down to the next generation, and by mating and random mutations, improved. Therefore the whole of the possible permutation space is never searched, but the search algorithm that is natural selection very effectively finds a working solution and one that is usually close to the optimum."

    "### 9.3 Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination is really a misnomer, because it is the number of ways of choosing $p$ distinguishable objects from a group of $n$ distinguishable objects, and the order of choosing these $p$ objects does not matter. If two letters from ABC are chosen, the number of combinations is three and the choices or combinations are AB $\\equiv$ BA, AC  $\\equiv$ CA, BC  $\\equiv$ CB because the order does not matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we think of placing objects into boxes, combinations, unlike permutations, allow more than one object to be placed in each box. For example, the letters ABC fill three boxes each containing two objects. Removing $p$ of the permutations is equivalent to dividing the objects into two groups, the chosen group of $p$ objects and another group of $n - p$ objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a permutation, there are $n!$ ways of choosing (if all the objects are different) and a combination must be less than this because the ordering of similar objects does not matter, and is less by the factorial of the number chosen, which is $p!$. Four objects A B C D produce $4! = 24$ permutations. If any three ($p = 3$) are chosen at a time, the four combinations $C(4, 3)$ are ABC, ACD, ABD, BCD. Each of these groups has $p! = 3! = 6$ permutations making $4 \\times 6 = 24$ permutations in total. Thus the number of combinations $C$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle C(n,p)=\\frac{p(n,p)}{p!} \\tag{20}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle C(n,p)=\\frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!}=\\binom{n}{p} \\tag{21}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second notation, 'n over p', is that used for the coefficients in the binomial expansion. As for permutations, the notations $_nC_p,\\; ^nC_p,\\; C_p^n$ are also commonly used. This number gives the coefficients in the binomial expansion and in the Binomial Probability distribution, see section 9.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original context of the word combination is that the number $C(n, p)$ is the number of combinations of $n$ things selected $p$ at a time. Since $\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{p}=\\binom{n}{n-p}$ this is also equal to the number of combinations of $n$ things selected $n-p$ at a time.\n",

The number of ways of making this choice is huge even for such small numbers, and is\n",

    "\n",
    "In a stack of energy levels such as in an atom, many transitions are possible from an upper level $n_2$ to a lower one $n_1$, when the selection rules are ignored. Thus level $6$ can have transitions to levels $5,4,3,2,1$, level $1$ being lowest, and level $5$ can then transfer to levels $4,3,2,1$ etc. The first step is to calculate the number of levels and this is just $n_2-n_1+1$. You can check this by drawing a set of levels. Next, each transition, of course, involves two levels so we need to find the number of ways of selecting two levels (objects) at a time out of the total and this is\n",

    "#### **Number of determinants in a MO calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Hartree-Fock self consistent field method of calculating molecular orbitals the wavefunction is described by spin orbitals that are arranged into Slater determinants (see chapter 7 Matrices). There are more spin orbitals than electrons because the wavefunction is expressed as a series of terms and the more terms included lower the energy. The determinants are used to ensure that the Pauli principle applies, which in its wider sense means that the wavefunction is antisymmetric when any two electron coordinates are exchanged. The calculation can be done with the smallest set of determinants, which means using just the lowest energy spin orbitals, but this does not generate the lowest possible energy. What is done is to make wavefunctions, described by Slater determinants, that correspond to one or more excitations and this lowers the energy. This is fine as far as it goes but the number of possible ways excitations can be achieved is vast, and this is of practical importance as each calculation involves evaluating an integral and so has implications on computer time and memory size. Including excited determinants is called *Configuration Interaction*. A typical example is that of benzene described by $72$ spin orbitals and $42$ electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of thinking of determinants, suppose that there are a number of energy levels, or boxes if you wish, into which particles are placed such that only one is allowed into any level. If, for example, there are $72$ levels and $42$ particles what are the number of ways that these can be placed? The number of combinations is $\\displaystyle \\binom{72}{42}=\\frac{72!}{42!30!}=1.6\\cdot 10^{20}$ which is vast. Next, suppose that only the lowest $42$ levels are occupied how many ways can we move a single particle at a time to an empty level. This would correspond to singly excited determinants and is the number of choices by which one particle can be moved and that is $30$ and so for all particles is $42\\cdot 30 = 1260$. Now if two are moved at a time (a doubly excited determinant) then the number is $\\displaystyle \\binom{42}{2}\\binom{72-42}{2}=374535$. The extension to moving three at a time is clear but we cannot move all of them at once because there are more particles than empty spaces. You can appreciate just how many integrals have to be evaluated when calculating benzene's molecular orbitals. \n"

The multiplicity is the number of states belonging to one level, i.e. the size of the degeneracy. Degeneracy and multiplicity do tend to be used interchangeably. If the angular momentum quantum number is $S$, then this state has a multiplicity of  $g = 2S + 1$ and is  $g = 2S + 1$ degenerate unless some specific interaction alters this.

In apparent contradiction an orbital can contain zero, one, or two electrons. Two electrons are allowed to be in an orbital if they have different quantum numbers and are therefore different fermions. An electron's spin quantum number is $S = 1/2$ but there is a second quantum number $m_s = \\pm 1/2$ who's value is related to the spin's orientation, colloquially spin 'up' or 'down', so that an orbital can have up to two different fermions in it.

    "When answering questions about the probability or chance of some event occurring, it is always worth considering whether the question is real. The question 'what is the chance that next Friday is the 13th?' is not a question involving chance, since checking with a calendar will produce the answer. Similarly, asking 'what is the chance that that runner will win this race?', or 'what is the chance that Portsmouth will beat Manchester United?' is not a question that probability theory can answer, since there are factors involved other than pure chance that make the outcome unpredictable. The question 'what is the chance that I will win the lottery?' is a question to which only a probabilistic, not predictable, answer can be given, provided of course that you have bought a ticket! A probabilistic answer is possible because one number is just as likely to be drawn as another is, otherwise the lottery would not be fair. The _just as likely_ is important here as it indicates that random chance is involved.\n",

This is because there are four outcomes HH, HT, TH and TT so the chance of observing HH is $1/4$. The chance of a head and a tail is $1/2$.  Thus the definition of probability is \n",

    "The foundations of this subject are based on the ideas of sets and subsets of objects and their properties; for example 'union' and 'intersection', Figure 20. A set is defined as a collection of objects such as the letters of the alphabet. A subset of these could be the vowels, {a, e, i, o, u}. The sample space is the total number of arrangements of objects that are possible for any particular problem. Flipping two coins has the sample space of four elements {HH, HT, TH, TT }. To determine an event or successful outcome is the purpose or object of the calculation, and is a subset of this sample space. Suppose that the event we want is that one head is to be produced when two coins are tossed; then this is the subset A = {HH, HT, TH}. If we want the event, which is two heads, then only one element exists and this is B = {HH}. An event such as B that contains only one sample point is called a simple event. As probability is defined as the ratio of the number of successful outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, the probability of observing event A, that of one head, is the number of arrangements for this event over the total number in the sample space, making the probability $3/4$. Similarly, observing two heads occurs on average $1/4$ of the times two coins are thrown.\n",

In the first case, outcome white = $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ and occurs with the probability (chance) $4/6$; a black face being uppermost occurs with a chance $2/6$.

    "\n",
    "#### **(i) Chance of observing a head on a coin and a $6$ on a dice**\n",
    "If a coin and a die are thrown they are clearly independent events and the chance of observing a head and a $6$ is $(1/2) \\times (1/6)$. This follows from the fundamental principle of counting; if a job is completed in $n$ ways and another in $m$ ways then both can be completed in $n \\times m$ ways. For instance, if there are $6$ types of anions and $8$ types of cations then $48$ different salts can be produced. Now, suppose that two dice are thrown and you want to find the chance that the total of their numbers is $10$. The two dice are independent, the result of one does not influence the other, and the probabilities therefore multiply. As one die can fall in one of six ways, two can fall in $6 \\times 6 = 36$ different ways. The number $10$ can be obtained in three different ways, each of which is equally likely to occur: $6 + 4,\\, 4 + 6,$ and $5 + 5$. The probability of observing $10$ is therefore $3/36$. If a sum of $6$ is sought, then this is produced in the combinations $1+5,\\, 5+1,\\, 4+2, \\,2+4, \\, 1+3$ and would be expected to be observed $5/36$ times the dice are thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(ii) Cards drawn in succession**\n",
    "If you want two cards containing the number $7$ to be drawn in succession from a pack of $52$ playing cards, what is the chance of this happening if the first card chosen is not replaced in the pack? The chance of the first $7$ being chosen is $4/52$ because there are four $7$'s in a pack of $52$ cards. It is now assumed that a $7$ has been removed and therefore the chance that the second card removed is a $7$ is $3/51$ making the chance $(4/51) \\times (3/51) = 1/221$ overall. The second choice is $3/51$ because we have only $51$ cards left and one $7$ is assumed to have been removed in our first try. Had we chosen to find the probability that a $7$ and a $6$ were to be removed in succession, the chance would be $(4/52) \\times (4/51)$. If instead we wanted to draw a $7$ or a $6$ from the pack, then the probability would be $4/52 + 4/52$ as these are independent of one another; drawing one card does not depend on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(iii) Independent events. Molecular yield**\n",
    "Independent events can occur in the way molecules react. If a molecule can react to produce two different products A and B with rate constants $k_A$ and $k_B$ respectively, the chance of product A being observed is $p_A = k_A/(k_A + k_B)$ and of B is $1 - p_A$, which is $p_B = k_B /(k_A + k_B)$. The sum of both events is 1. In chemistry, probability $p_A$ is normally called the yield of A and is often expressed as a percentage. If an excited state of a molecule can fluoresce with rate constant $k_f$ or produce another state such as a triplet by intersystem crossing with rate constant $k_i$ then the fluorescence yield is $k_f /(k_f + k_i)$ and the triplet yield $k_i /(k_f + k_i)$.\n",

    "#### **(iv) Cards drawn but not replaced**\n",
    "Suppose that two cards are drawn from a pack and the first not replaced, and we want the chance that the second is a $7$ of diamonds. This question has two answers. If the first card happens to be the $7$, then the chance of the second being this card is obviously zero. If the first card is not the $7$ of diamonds, the chance of choosing it a second time is $1/51$ making the chance $(1/52) \\times (1/51)$ overall.\n",

    "#### **(v) Throw a die $n$ time**\n",
    "Suppose a die is thrown $n$ times, what will be the chance that a $3$ appears at least once? In one throw the $3$ appears with a chance $1/6$ and there is a $5/6$ chance that it does not appear. After $n$ throws, then the chance is $(5/6)^n$ that the $3$ does not appear and therefore $1 - (5/6)^n$ that it appears at least once. For two throws, this is $11/36$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This calculation can also be described using inclusive probability. Suppose that there are two outcomes A and B, and at least one outcome is required, then the probability is that of event A, plus event B minus that of both A and B or p = p(A) + p(B) - p(AB). The chance that a $3$ is thrown, is $1/6$ on the first throw (outcome A), and again on the second throw is $1/6$, and the chance of both occurring p(AB) = $1/36$ making $1/6 + 1/6 - 1/36 = 11/36$ overall.\n",

    "To illustrate explicitly the use of a sample space, consider the problem of calculating whether at least two people from a group of $25$ people have the same birthday (see Goldberg 1986, p. 53). First, to simplify the calculation it is necessary to ignore leap years, and then to assume that there are no twins in the group and that births occur with equal probability throughout the year. None of these may be true in a real sample of people, but we will assume that they are.\n",

The sample space is huge, $n_s = 365^{25}$, because this is the number of ways that the birthdays can be arranged. Let $n_A$ be the number of arrangements where at least two people have the same birthday and $n_{NA}$ the number of those with different birthdays, then $n_{NA}$ is the number of ways of selecting $25$ different days from $365$. \n",

The effect might of course just be random, however, only $3$ in $19$ different types of protein have blue shifts so its seems that a random effect is unlikely.

Of course, it is also possible to find the chance that $1,2,\\cdots$ only are present.\n",

The probability $q = 0.01109$ and the calculation that there is no $^{13}$C is present sets $m=0$, i.e $P(60,\\,0,\\,0.01109)$.

In each theoretical plate there is equilibrium between the mobile and the stationary phase, but not between one plate and its neighbour because the mobile phase flows through the column. The solid or stationary phase consists of the packing material in the column and onto which the solute adsorbs and then desorbs back into the mobile phase at a later time. The number of plates is large, typically several hundred to a few thousand per metre of column. This is a model based just on probabilities and ignores any of the kinetics of forming and being released from a surface or any molecular properties.\n",

    "To calculate the movement down the column we suppose that movement happens in a series of steps $n$ and because the mobile phase flows through the column $n$ can be larger than the number of theoretical plates. Initially $m_0$ moles of solute injected into the column and equilibrium is formed (mobile to solid phase) in the first plate producing $m_0p$ in the mobile phase and $(1-p)m_0$ in the stationary phase. Next, the mobile phase with its amount $m_0p$ solute at plate 0 passes this to plate 1 (initially empty) and plate 0 and 1 reach equilibrium. Note that just after moving to plate 1, the mobile phase in plate 0 has has zero solute until this equilibrates with the solid phase. At step two the amount in the mobile phase in plate 1 moves to plate 2, and plate 2 equilibrates, and the amount in the mobile phase in plate 0 also moves to plate 1 and equilibrates again. The process repeats as molecules move down the column. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can understand that as some molecules are retained at each step on the stationary phase the injected material initially in plate 0 spreads out among the plates as the mobile phase moves along the column. The profile observed at the end of the column by the detector will therefore have a certain rising and falling shape depending on just how long the molecules are retained at each plate, i.e. depending on the partition constant between stationary and mobile phases vs. how fast the flow rate is. As the amount injected into the column is fixed, the broader the detected profile is the less is its intensity. Clearly what is aimed for is an intense narrow profile so that many species can be identified at once depending on their differing partition constants.\n",

    "The equilibration partitions the amount in the mobile and solid phase as $p:(1-p)$. The calculation for the fist step is that $m_0p$ is partitioned into the mobile phase and therefore $m_0 - m_0p = m_0(1-p)$ adsorbed onto the stationary phase. In the next step the mobile phase moves to the next empty plate and $m_0p$ is partitioned between phases meaning that at equilibrium $m_p^2$ is in the mobile and $m_0p(1-p)$ in the stationary phase. The amount $m_0p^2$ is transferred to the third plate and equilibrated, and $m_0p(1-p)$ from the first plate moves to the second and equilibrates. The table shows the scheme.

    "An alternative way of forming the binomial coefficient $\\displaystyle \\frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}$ in equation 25a is to consider many of two different types of atoms, e.g. He and Ne, or types of snooker balls, e.g. red and white which gives a reasonable analogy as He and Ne have no strong interactions between then when not in contact and neither do billiard balls. Suppose that we place the balls into a jar so that red and white layers are apparent. Next by shaking the jar this arrangement is lost and a irregular looking one is formed. In fact if shaking is continued the ordered layers are almost never going to be seen again. This means that the ordered starting point is just one possibility of a truly vast number of others and returning to the original arrangement is highly unlikely which means that the probability of this is extremely small.\n",

We want to split the balls into 2 groups with, in this case, 50 balls in each but we are not concerned with the order in which they are put into each group. There are $50!$ ways of putting the first $50$ white balls into the first half. Next, the number of ways of selecting the $m$ groups multiplied by the number of permutation in the first and multiplied by the number of permutations in the second group gives the total possible number of permutations.

The distribution is asymmetric and skewed for small positive numbers, $n \\ge 0$, because it is not possible to have a negative number of events. This distribution is observed when photons are counted or particles counted after a radioactive atom disintegrates, provided their decay time is long compared to the observation time. However, the distribution applies to many other types of events, such as the number of faulty CDs produced, the number of misprints on a printed page, or the number of students absent from a class in any week. One of the earliest examples was recorded over a 20-year period during the 1800's, and was the number of deaths of infantrymen occurred in the Prussian army after they were kicked by a horse.\n",

The number of electrical pulses from the detector for, say, $1000$ time intervals each of $1$ second duration is recorded. If a _histogram_ of the number of events recorded in each time interval is made, then this should follow a Poisson distribution. \n",

    "If DNA is exposed to UV light, photo-damage can occur by base pairs forming dimers. If the DNA is spliced into pieces of equal length, the number of dimers in each piece can be recorded. If the pieces are each very small, $10$ base pairs for example, most will not contain a dimer, a few will contain one and fewer still will contain two or more and so on. The distribution formed will have a large value for zero dimers and become smaller as the number of dimers increases. In a second experiment, suppose that $100$ base pair long segments are examined. Now only a few segments have no dimer, some have one and many have two, three, or four but fewer segments will have five or more. This distribution is now peaked at a value of, say, $2.5$. Repeating the experiment with a larger segment will cause the distribution to peak at still larger values until it closely resembles a normal or Gaussian distribution. What has changed between the experiments is only the average number of dimers detected in each segment, thus the Poisson distribution is determined by only one parameter, the average number of 'events'. A similar argument applies to the number of photons or particles detected in progressively longer time intervals.\n",

    "### 9.15 Genetics\n",
    "\n",
    "Mendel discovered that pure bred but different strains of peas gave rise to offspring that showed different features but did so in definite proportions. His peas had yellow and green seeds, but 75.05% of the offspring in 8023 trials were yellow, and the remainder, green. Others have since found very similar numbers in even larger trials and in other organisms, such as fruit flies or mice (Maynard Smith 1995). The genetic information we now know is encoded in DNA. The regions involved in transmitting genetic information are called genes, and these form part of a chromosome of which several different types are present in an organism. We are familiar with the observation that the probability with which molecules react is exponentially distributed, which is expressed in the Arrhenius rate equation, the rate being probability/time. In genetics, the situation is entirely different. The probability distribution is flat and the chance that genes mix genetic information occurs with the same constant probability as if they were selected out of boxes, each one being equally probable. Although these genes 'mix' during reproduction, they still retain their own identity and are passed down through the generations. An individual needs two genes to express a trait; yellow vs green seeds or stumpy vs normal wings in a fruit fly, and these mix freely from both parents to produce offspring. These traits are usually called _phenotypes_. The traits the offspring show are expected to be those of the parents, but depending on the genetic make up (_genotype_) of the parent, some traits appear less than would be expected from simple numerology. The reason for this is that some genes are recessive to others and therefore a characteristic trait does not manifest itself in the presence of a dominant gene. Only when the genotype is examined can the true make-up of an individual be found.\n",

    "If the two genes from each parent are described as Y or y and G or g they can be arranged in a diagram. The uppercase letter indicates a dominant gene, the lower case a recessive. Starting with the pure strains YY and yy, which are called _homozygous_, the first generation (F1) are _heterozygous_ Yy. If these are now bred, the homozygous reappear with the heterozygous, Figure 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the yellow colour in the pea seeds is dominant over the green, although this is not reflected in the genetic make-up (the genotype), the chance of observing yellow peas is therefore $75$%, which is very close to that observed experimentally. The chance of observing YY and yy genotypes is $1/4$ in each case, and of the hybrid Yy, $1/2$, because the genes mix freely but retain their own identity, rather like atoms do in forming a molecule. The yellow seeded plants are present in the ratio 3:1 over the green ones. The phenotype ratio yellow to green is therefore $3:1$, or put another way, yellow seeded plants are expected to be observed on average in $3/4$ of all experiments. If a homozygous plant is crossed with a heterozygous one, the chances that green and yellow seeded plants will be produced are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, say, $n= 20$ experiments are performed it should not be assumed that exactly equal numbers of green and yellow seeded plants will be observed since the number of experiments are small and many factors may influence what the plant looks like. This 'noise' means that accurate and precise ratios are only produced after averaging a large number of experiments. The numbers could range from $0 \\to 20$ but the average should be $10$ with the actual probabilities being distributed according to the binomial theorem. The chance (frequency) of observing $m$ green plants is then from the binomial distribution\n",

    "which works out to be a very small number, $9.5 \\times 10^{-7}$ of observing $0$ or $20$ green pea seeds. The chance of there being exactly $10$ plants of each type is $46189/262144 = 0.1762$ or $17.6$%. The chance that the actual result differs by $\\pm 1$ from the average value of $10$ is\n",
