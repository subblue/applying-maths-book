    "**Strategy:** Use the code and parameters given in the text. Vary the rate constants to get an idea of the sensitivity of the fit to these values.\n",

    "**Q18** Use Python's 'solve' routine routine to integrate the SIR equations using the data in Fig. 11.17, but automate the fitting by using a very simple, but inefficient,  grid search to vary $k_2$ and $k_1$ with $10$ values each, incrementing each value and so find the optimum values. Use two do loops to do this, setting back to the initial values one of the rate constants after the inner loop is completed but allowing the other to vary. Estimate the 'goodness' of each fit by calculating the *residual* which is the sum of the square of the difference between each of  the calculated values and the corresponding data point; $\\sum_i (calculated_i - data_i )^2$ . Make a contour plot to determine the range where the best parameters fitting the data can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The square of the difference is taken in the residual because some differences may be  negative. As smaller values of the residual are found, narrow the search area to 'home in' on the best estimates. The grid search is a slow but effective way of searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the SIR model, confirm that $k_2$ is in the range $0.001 \\to 0.004\\,\\mathrm{ day^{-1}}$ and $k_1$ is in range $0.2 \\to 0.6\\,\\mathrm{ day^{-1}}$.\n",

The result is unexpected, increase $N$ and the precision of the calculation. Try to explain why the calculation fails. Repeat with Python's built-in routine.\n",
