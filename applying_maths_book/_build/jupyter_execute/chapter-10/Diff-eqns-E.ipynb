However, it is quite complicated to use and specialized texts should be consulted (Jeffery 1990; Bronson 1994; Aratyn & Rasinariu 2006). There are, however, at least two methods that can still be used: the main one is to solve the equation as a series expansion and the second reduces the equation to a simpler one, but this can be used only in certain cases.\n",

    "## 14.2 Series solution of differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "While many types of equations can be solved using the methods described so far, there are a number of problems whose equations can only be solved by a series expansion. These are often different forms of the Schroedinger equation, examples of which are the quantum harmonic oscillator and the radial and angular solutions to the hydrogen atom. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the series solution method will be described in general, in quantum mechanics and in some other problems, the equations often have a form whose solution is well known because the equation has a specific name. The harmonic oscillator is solved using Hermite's differential equation and the hydrogen atom requires Legendre's and Laguerre's equations. Other commonly used equations are named after Helmholtz, Laplace, and Bessel.\n",

    "\n",
    "By taking derivatives of $y$ based on this expansion, the differential equation can be reconstructed in terms of the powers of $x$ and these constants. To find the constants, the powers of $x$ are collected together and the resulting group of constants solved assuming that each group of them is zero. What results is a recursion formula with which to calculate the constants and so the equation is solved without any formal integration. It is assumed that the solution can be found with this method, because this is 'usually' the case for problems in chemical physics. There is a simple way to check if a series solution is possible and if not, a related method due to Frobenius can be tried in these cases.\n",

    "so has a singular point at $x$=0. In this case, the equation can be shown to have solutions $\\displaystyle y=x^m \\sum \\limits_{k=0}^\\infty  a_kx^k$ and where $a_0 \\ne$ 0. Using this series is often called Frobeniusâ€™ method and both the index $m$ and coefficients $a_k$ have to be determined. The method is very similar to that already described and is given in more advanced textbooks (Boas 1983; Jeffery 1990; Bronson 1994; Aratyn & Rasinariu 2006)."
