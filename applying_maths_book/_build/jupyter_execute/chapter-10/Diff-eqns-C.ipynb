    "### 6 Using the D operator\n",
    "To be able to analyse more complex problems, linear second-order differential equations of the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+a\\frac{dy}{dx}+by=f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "are often produced. These equations occur in a number of different situations from chemical kinetics, to the motion of molecules damped by the viscosity of a fluid, or the forced oscillations of the harmonic oscillator. \n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward mathematical approach is available, which is the '-D-' operator method. Note that this only applies when the coefficients are constant; for example, the equation \n",

    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+x\\frac{dy}{dx}+by=f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "does _not_ have constant coefficients nor does the Schroedinger equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of linear differential equations with constant coefficients will always be a sum of exponential terms. If the exponentials are complex, and so contain $i$, then the solution can usually be expressed as sine and cosine functions. The methods described here are adapted from Gow(1964). First, the operator rules are described which we are familiar with from 'normal' differentiation. The equations with $f(x) = 0$ are solved next and then those when this is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Rules of Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that if the differential operator $dy/dx$ is replaced by $D$ and $d^2y/dx^2$ by $D^2$ and so forth, the rules of differentiation can be worked out by allowing $D$ to operate on the functions that follow it. For equations with constant coefficients, the $D$ operators formally follow the rules that are valid for polynomials. Some of these results are worked out here, as they will be needed later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle  D \\to dy/dx \\qquad D^2 \\to d^2y/dx^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$**(i)** If $u$ and $t$ are functions of $x$, then $ D(u + t) = Du + Dt$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$**(ii)** The operator can also act on itself just as in repeated differentiation, $D(Dy) = D^2y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also act somewhat as a normal variable; thus, it can be multiplied but division is not possible;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle(D-1)(1+D^2)= D^3 -D^2 +D-1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating on a function gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle\\begin{align} (D-1)(1+D^2)\\sin(3x)&=(D^3 -D^2 +D-1)\\sin(3x) \\\\ &= -24 \\cos(3x) + 8 \\sin(3x)\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the same result is obtained without expanding the $D$'s first, but operating first with $(1+D^2)$ and then $(D-1)$ or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$**(iii)** When operating on exponentials the result is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle De^{kx}=ke^{kx} \\qquad \\text{ and} \\qquad D^ne^{kx}=k^ne^{kx}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "if $n$ is an integer and $k$ is a constant. In conventional notation $\\displaystyle \\frac{d^n}{dx^n}e^{kx}=k^ne^{kx}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$**(iv)** If $\\varphi(D)$ represents a polynomial in the _D_ operator, such as $\\varphi(D)=D^2 + D - 3$, the effect it has on the exponential function $ e^{kx}$, for example, is\n",

    "### 6.2 There are many solutions to a linear differential equation\n",
    "\n",
    "If the differential equation is expressed as $\\varphi(D)y = 0$ where $\\varphi(D)$ is a polynomial in the operator $D$, such as $(D - 1)(D + 2)$, then there are two solutions if the equation is second order, and three if third order, and so forth. These solutions are labelled $y_1$ and $y_2$, but the sum of these two solutions is also a solution when $y_1$ and $y_2$ are multiplied by constants $a_1$ and $a_2$. Thus \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle y=a_1y_1 +a_2y_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the general form of the solution. The functions $y_1$ and $y_2$ are functions of $x$ (they are often but not always exponentials) and are found systematically as shown next, and $a_1$ and $a_2$ are determined by the initial or boundary conditions. The last equation can be shown to be true by operating on it with $\\varphi(D)$; for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle\\varphi(D)(a_1y_1 + a_2y_2) = a_1\\varphi(D)y_1 + a_2\\varphi(D)y_2 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $y_n (n = 1, 2)$ by definition solves this equation, hence $\\varphi(D)y_n = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two solutions $y_1$ and $y_2$ must be linearly independent of one another, which they are, if one is not a constant multiple of the other. This means that if $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants and both are not zero, then $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 = 0$ over the range of $x$ values defined for the particular equation. A determinant of derivatives of the possible solutions, called a Wronskian (Arkfen 1970; Jeffery 1990), can be formed to check if the solutions are independent, see Section 4.3 case (iii).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Using auxiliary equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The first-order equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle(D - a)y = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the same as $\\displaystyle \\frac{dy}{dx} - ay = 0$ and has the solution $\\displaystyle y = Ae^{ax}$ where the constant $A$ is determined by the initial conditions. If the equation is written as $\\displaystyle (D - a)e^{ax} = 0$, the solution is proved by differentiating $\\displaystyle (D - a)e^{ax} = ae^{ax} - ae^{ax} = 0$.\n",

    "In a second-order equation,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle (D - a)(D - b)y = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we hypothesize that the equation is satisfied by exponential functions such as $\\displaystyle y = e^{kx}$ where $k$ is a constant to be determined. The way to find $k$ is to substitute the answer into the equation $\\displaystyle (D - a)(D - b)e^{kx} = 0$ and expand, viz.,\n",

    "\n",
    "Equations of the form $\\varphi(D)y = b \\sin(mx)$ and $\\varphi(D)y = b\\cos(mx)$ often describe forces and simple harmonic motion where the driving force is a sine or cosine. To solve this type of equation, use the exponential from $\\displaystyle e^{imx}$ etc. to replace the sine or cosine term. The real part is then extracted if $f(x)$ is a cosine, and the imaginary part if a sine, because $\\displaystyle e^{\\pm iax} = \\cos(ax) \\pm i\\sin(ax)$. This method is therefore effectively the same as the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the equation is $\\displaystyle 2\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-5\\frac{dy}{dx}-3y=7\\sin(4x)$  the complementary function is found with $(2D + 1)(D − 3)y = 0$ which has roots −1/2 and 3 and gives $\\displaystyle y_h=Ae^{-x/2}+Be^{3x}$. Replacing the sine by an exponential makes a particular integral\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle y_p=7\\frac{1}{2D^2-5D-3}e^{4ix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using $m=4i$ gives the solution $\\displaystyle y_p=7\\frac{1}{32i^2-20i-3}e^{4ix}$. This can be simplified by multiplying top and bottom by the conjugate of the complex number,\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle y_p=7\\left(\\frac{1}{-35-20i}  \\right)\\left(\\frac{-35+20i}{-35+20i}  \\right)e^{4ix}=\\left(-\\frac{49}{325}+\\frac{28}{350} i \\right)e^{4ix}$$ \n",

    "\n",
    "The equations we have been solving are of the type found when oscillators have, in addition to acceleration, a damping term due to viscous effects, and another term if an external force drives the oscillator. The effect of damping is to dissipate the energy from the moving body into the surrounding medium where it ends up as heat. Consequently, if an external force does not drive the body, the damping eventually brings the body to rest. In the presence of a constant force such as gravity the damping due to air resistance will cause a falling object to reach a constant terminal velocity. On the molecular scale, a charged protein moving in the presence of an external electric field will be accelerated and driven along by the field but this motion will be constrained by the viscous drag effects due to interaction with the solvent. The equations used to describe the motion of bodies in fluids can be 'mapped' onto those describing electronic circuits consisting of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the oscillator is not driven but is in a viscous medium, a pendulum in air for example, the equation of motion is modified from that given in Section 3.2, and the motion is described as exhibiting _free damped oscillations_. The damping naturally resists motion, and it is often assumed to be linearly proportional to the speed. The force it produces is $-cdx/dt$ where $c$ is a constant of proportionality and is the damping coefficient and has units kg s$^{-1}$. The negative sign in front of $c$ ensures that damping resists motion.\n",

The ratio $t/T$ is the number of periods for the oscillator to lose 1/$e$ of its amplitude. If the oscillator is lightly damped, then the $Q$ is large and _vice versa_. The idea of $Q$ factors is, however, more important in the driven damped oscillator; the closer the driven frequency is to the free or natural oscillator frequency, the greater the $Q$ factor is.

    "#### Q-switching lasers.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q$-switching is used to produce intense nanosecond duration laser pulses, which are used to measure rates of chemical reactions; they are also used in cutting and welding materials and in laser ranging or 'lidar'. Siegman (1986) describes Q-switching in detail but the basic idea is as follows. The gain material is excited by flash lamps or laser diodes but the laser cavity is initially held in a condition of low gain, so it cannot lase even though the gain medium, such as Nd$^{3+}$ ions in YAG, is being excited. The gain is forced to be low by an electro-optic polarizer inserted inside the laser cavity. This is aligned so that those photons that reach the cavity mirrors are not fed back into the gain medium with the correct polarization and are therefore not amplified. As the gain material is excited, a large population inversion soon results and consequently it contains a large amount of stored energy. A laser pulse is now made by suddenly increasing the $Q$ of the laser cavity by increasing the gain. This can be done by switching the state of the electro-optic polarizer so that light can now travel back and forth between the mirrors. The effect that this has is to cause a very rapid rise in the gain of the cavity because, by stimulated emission, the stored energy is converted into photons, and a laser pulse of a few nanoseconds duration is produced. The photons deplete the gain far more rapidly than it can be replenished by excitation from the flash lamps, and the gain drops, terminating the laser pulse. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $Q$ of an optical cavity is given by $Q = \\omega E/(-dE/dt)$, where $\\omega$ is the laser frequency, $E$ the energy, and $dE/dt$ the power or rate of change of energy. The Nd YAG laser operates at $1064$ nm and can typically produce a $1$ J, 10 ns duration $Q$-switched laser pulse. If the cavity gain is switched in $10$ ns, then the $Q$ of the cavity is, for a short period, extremely high at $\\approx$ $3$ million.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Atomic Force Microscope\n",
    "\n",
    "The $Q$ of mechanical systems is also important. The scanning atomic force microscope, AFM, has a microscopic cantilever with an even smaller tip at its base. The first type of instruments worked in contact mode where the tip was dragged over a surface using piezoelectric actuators to control its position. The distance from the surface was measured by how much the cantilever was bent by the surface forces. In this mode, the surface can be damaged by the tip. To prevent this and to increase the quality of the images, the tip can be made to oscillate up and down when driven by a piezoelectric crystal and it only 'taps' the surface once per period. The electrons in an atom on the surface interact with the tip as it approaches and it does not have to touch a molecule for its presence to be felt. The oscillation's amplitude ($ \\approx 20$ nm) is maintained by a feedback loop and, as it approaches a molecule on the surface, the oscillation frequency changes and so the feedback changes also thus providing a measure of the surface shape. If the $Q$ of the cantilever is high, then the amplitude of the cantilever's response is large when the driving frequency is close to that of its natural frequency and is small at other frequencies. When a molecule is encountered, the force on the cantilever changes its frequency by a small amount, which because the $Q$ is high, causes a large change in its amplitude; see Fig. 14 thus increasing sensitivity. The $Q$ of the cantilever can be as high as $20000$ when operated at $250$ kHz and images with resolution of a few angstrom are possible.\n",

    "### 6.12 Brownian motion\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1828, the naturalist Robert Brown (Brown, 1828) reported that the motion of pollen seen under the microscope never ceases. The same was soon shown to be true of microscopic particles of glass, minerals, petrified wood, and even stone from the Egyptian Sphinx. Various causes were investigated; convection currents, uneven evaporation, capillary action, and so forth, but none proved to be responsible. We now understand that Brownian motion is due to the ceaseless, thermally induced motion of all molecules colliding with one another and with larger particles and in doing so moving them. Because the number of collisions with a particle is not the same in all directions at each instant in time, the forces will not always cancel exactly and the particle will be knocked about in a random manner. Figure 14a shows a simulation of a random walk in two dimensions. In 1910, Perrin observed and recorded the random motion of a single particle under the microscope and measured the average of the square of the distance moved $\\langle x^2\\rangle$ in periods of $30$ seconds, the scale being of a few tens of micrometres. Einstein had previously calculated what the average displacement should be in a given time period. \n",

In three dimensions the average is therefore $3k_BT/2$. A particle moving in a harmonic potential has a contribution of $k_BT/2$ from its kinetic energy and $k_BT/2$ from its potential energy, since this energy is $kx^2/2$ for a displacement $x$ and force constant $k$. The total average energy is therefore $k_BT$.\n",

There are two steps to doing this. First, a differential equation for $\\displaystyle x^2$ is sought and, secondly, its average over time is found and the equipartition theorem is used to do this. Although the averaging can be done before integrating, as this greatly simplifies the calculation, it is not essential because integration is a sum and the order of integrating and averaging can be interchanged. In physical terms, averaging before integrating is valid because we can repeatedly observe the displacement of one particle at each of several time steps and average the results, or we can observe many particles simultaneously, averaging after each time step. The ergodic hypothesis states that these approaches are equivalent.\n",

    "This equation has proved very successful in predicting the diffusional properties of molecules and properties depending on diffusion, such as the rate constants of diffusion controlled chemical reactions, even though the equations strictly relate only to macroscopic particles. As a rule of thumb, we can feel confident in using the equation if the solvent is smaller than the molecule diffusing in it, because the derivation assumes a continuous structureless solvent, and not a molecular one. When you use these equations, note that the SI unit of viscosity is Pa s ($\\mathrm{kg\\, m^{-1} s^{-1}}$) but the common unit is centipoise and $1$ Pa s = $10^{-3}$ cP. The diffusion coefficient $D$ has units of $\\mathrm{m^2\\, s^{-1}}$.\n"
