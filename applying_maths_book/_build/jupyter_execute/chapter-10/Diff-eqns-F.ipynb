    "### 9.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Many important phenomena in chemistry, physics, and biology involve partial differential equations; for example, the Schroedinger, wave, and diffusion equations. Although the general theory of partial differential equations is well beyond the scope of this book, the equations mentioned are among those whose solutions can be obtained by a powerful method known as the separation of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest type of partial differential equation has two independent variables, $x$ and $y$, and its solution must represent a surface rather than a curve as does that of an ordinary differential equation. The ordinary differential equation has arbitrary constants as a result of integration, which are determined by the initial or boundary conditions; the partial differential equation has instead _arbitrary functions_ of integration and these have to be eliminated to obtain a particular solution. The problem is not that there are too few arbitrary functions to solve the equation but that there are too many. An example given by Stephenson (1996) illustrates this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the equation formed by differentiating $w = yf(x)$ with respect to $y$, and where $f(x)$ is a general, unspecified function of $x$. The differential is $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} = f(x)$ and by substitution to eliminate $f(x)$ the partial differential equation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle y\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}-w=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a first-order equation. The solution to this is $f(x)$ but as this function was not specified, it is therefore _any arbitrary function_. Exactly what this function might be has to be determined by using the initial or boundary conditions imposed on the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a second example, the one-dimensional wave equation will be 'solved'. This equation has the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial t^2}=a^2\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider now the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle u=f_1(x+at)+f_2(x-at)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the functions $f$ are arbitrary and are not defined in any real sense. To find a solution we differentiate twice by $x$ then twice by $t$ and add the results. Let $x + at \\equiv r$ and $x âˆ’ at \\equiv s$, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial (f_1+f_2)}{\\partial r}\\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial (f_1+f_2)}{\\partial s}\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial x} =f'(x+at)+f'_2(x-at)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and similarly \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2}=f''_1(x+at)+f''(x-at) ; \\qquad \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial t^2}=a^2f''_1(x+at)+a^2f''(x-at)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and adding these two equations and eliminating the functions produces the wave equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial t^2}=a^2\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To convince yourself of the arbitrary, and hence not very useful nature of the functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ that solve the wave equation, use Sympy to do the algebra on a few functions with arguments $x \\pm at$. The functions (see box below) are differentiated twice in $t$ and $x$ and then the wave equation is formed and the result is zero, proving that the functions we choose are in fact solutions. This method is therefore a way of solving the equation, but in many cases, the method of separating variables is more satisfactory and is described next."

    "This method assumes that the solution to the partial differential equation is based on splitting the problem into two parts. In the diffusion equation the quantity required is usually the concentration of a species as a function of time and of position. The solution is therefore found using $c(x,t) = c(x)c(t)$ and splitting the partial differential equation into two parts, one, which depends on time alone and the other on position alone. Both these equations are then made equal to a constant and each can be solved. To find the constants introduced by integration, and thus the exact form of the solution, the initial and boundary conditions are now used. Finding these constants often, but not always, involves expanding the solution as a Fourier series. Solving the differential equations is often the simpler part of the calculation; handing the boundary conditions can involve more work. Some examples are now given.\n",

The sides of the bar are kept at zero degrees and the end constantly heated to $T$ degrees; for generality, this temperature profile is called $f(y)$. The sketch, Fig. 10.22 shows the situation.\n",

    "To find the time profile of the non-equilibrium concentration of a solute in solution, the diffusion equation, or Fick's second law, is required. Imagine that a partition separates a solution from pure solvent. When the partition is removed, without otherwise disturbing the solution, diffusion of solute into the solvent occurs and _vice versa_. At any given place the concentration is changing as time progresses. At any given time, there is a concentration profile along the whole sample. Fick's First Law states that the flux is proportional to the negative gradient of concentration with distance, multiplied by the diffusion constant, or,\n",

The times are given next to the lines and are in nanoseconds. The oscillating grey line at the top of the figure is set at $0.01$ ns and shows that close to zero time the sine functions almost but not exactly cancel out one another even with $100$ terms in the summation.  The plot also shows how slow diffusion is as it takes $\\approx 600$ ns for the molecules to be removed and the concentration to approach zero.\n",

By capillary action, similar to that which occurs in thin layer chromatography, the fluid containing the analyte passes through to a second region containing antibodies (immunoglobulins) attached to silver or gold nanoparticles. The fluid then passes into a ribbon of nitrocellulose impregnated with reporter antibodies in two specific places, the first to trap any analyte containing species and the second as a test region to confirm that flow has occurred. Finally this ribbon is attached to a wick that ensures that flow continues until no more fluid is left.\n",

However, even with an excess of X it takes time to establish equilibrium. The forward (binding) rate constant $k$ is important because the species are flowing through the reactive region. (The reverse rate constant can be ignored when the equilibrium constant is large). The (bimolecular) limit to the half-life forming the complex AbAX is, assuming that X is in excess and so pseudo-first order, $\\ln(2)/kX$ where typically $k = 10^5\\,\\mathrm{dm^3\\,mol^{-1}\\, s^{-1}}$ and $X= 10^{-6}\\;\\mathrm{dm^3\\,mol^{-1}}$.

Of course this assumes that the amount of X is in sufficient excess compared to AbA. As the half-life is a product of terms an increase either in concentration of X or rate constant $k$ will greatly reduce the half-life and increase detection, and *vice versa*. In other words the success of such a device depends crucially on timing,  rate constants and concentrations. The similar argument can be made for the first reaction forming AbA, although in that case there is extra time because the conjugate mixing region has a larger volume and hence lower flow rates than in the nitrocellulose giving more time for reaction, plus the time taken to reach the detecting region.\n",
