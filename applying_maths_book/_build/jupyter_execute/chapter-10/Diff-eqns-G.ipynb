This initial condition is quite specific, and practical, but instead of keeping a constant value $c_0$ when $x \\ge 0$ and $t = 0$ the initial concentration can in general be a function of position, $f(x)$ which may range over the whole range of $x$.\n",

    "Fourier transforming a differential equation, such as the Schroedinger or diffusion equations often leads to a simpler equation in transformed space and one that can be solved easily. To get at the complete solution this equation has to be transformed back into 'real space' and even though this is now only involves an integral this can sometimes be tricky. If an analytic solution is not possible a numerical transform can be used.\n",

Tunnelling is apparent into the non-classical region at large $x$ but not at $x=0$ because here the potential is infinitely high.

Additionally lateral and rotational diffusion or energy transfer smears out the fringes, thus providing a way of measuring these properties *via* the decrease in diffracted intensity of a probe laser. Similarly thermal gratings can be produced and probed. \n",

    "The weak probe laser can be at the same or a different wavelength to the pump and is aligned to be diffracted into a different spatial position to the pump so is easily identified against a dark background. The technique varies a little depending upon what is measured but usually short pulse lasers are used, picosecond or femtosecond and in this case it is clearly essential that they arrive in the sample at the same time. As an example, if polarised light is used those molecules whose transition dipole is aligned with the polarisation of the pump (with a $\\cos^2(\\theta)$ probability ) are preferentially excited. Subsequent rotational diffusion of the excited molecules can be measured because as the molecules rotate the polarised grating is diminished as the initially aligned transition moments are randomised and therefore the probe pulse has fewer molecule aligned with its polarisation to interact with. By measuring at different delay times, wrt. the pump laser, the probe pulse can map out the rotational diffusion in a pump-and-probe manner.\n",

    "\n",
    "which has the same form as that for 1D diffusion but with the extra term in $y$. There is no term in the product $xy$ so this is in effect rather like two separate equations. If the fourier transforms are taken as above in terms of $x$ and $y$ and necessarily using $k_x$ and $k_y$ instead of just $k$ the result is just the product of two 1D terms. Following the method above the transform equation is \n",

    "where the integral $\\int\\int e^{-D(k_x^2+k_y^2)t}e^{i(k_xx+k_yy)} dk_xdk_y $ is split into two because, as mentioned, there is no term in $xy$. The $x^2+y^2$ in the exponential means that $x$ and $y$ are interchangeable, or put another way that diffusion is the same in the $x$ and $y$ directions, i.e. is spherically symmetrical and we can consider that $x^2+y^2=r^2$ where $r$ is the radius of the diffusing material, this with a delta function placed at $x=y=0$ shows that the concentration spreads out spherically while its peak height reduces. This, naturally, has the be the case because the amount of material is constant.  The effect is shown in figure 30g. Finally note that the solution to Fick's law, in any dimension, cannot apply at $t=0$, as the concentration would have to become infinite.  The short time behaviour is completely missing and more sophisticated models, are needed here. \n",

First we should check that the concentration profile over all coordinates is normalised to unity, since we used a delta function as the boundary condition when solving the equations.
