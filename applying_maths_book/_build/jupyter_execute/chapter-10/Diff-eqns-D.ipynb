Here it is converted into a second-order equation and solved using the $D$ operator method. The rate equations are,\n",

    "The solution can be written down after solving the characteristic equation $\\displaystyle m^2 + (k_1 + k_2)m + k_1k_2 = 0$, which has roots $m = -k_1, -k_2$. The homogeneous equation is \n",

    "and the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ are, as usual, determined by the initial conditions. If for instance, $A_0$ is the initial concentration of A, and B and C are initially zero, then since C does not decay, $C = A_0 - A - B$. Because $B$ is initially zero, then\n",

    "There are important chemical examples of the case when the rate constants are all equal at $k$ in the scheme $A \\to B \\to C$, notably the mechanical unfolding of proteins and DNA using an atomic force microscope. The fact that all the rate constants are equal does not mean that the concentration of B is zero at all times, even though it is formed at the same rate as it decays. Taking the last result, it is not possible to make $k_1 = k_2$ because the concentration of B becomes undefined as 0/0, however, l'Hopital's rule could, in this case, be used to find the limit $k_2 - k_1 \\to 0$, (see Chapter 3.8). Instead, we start with the combined rate equations as in section 7.1, \n",

    "\n",
    "The roots of the auxiliary equation are $m = -k, -k$, and, as they are the same, the method of Section 4.3(iii) has to be used. The first part of the solution is $\\displaystyle B = c_1e^{- kt} + B_1$ where $B_1$ is a new function of $t$, which has yet to be found. This solution is normally guessed (from experience), and then tried to see if it fits the equation. As a test, let $\\displaystyle B_1 = c_2te^{- kt}$  making the solution\n",

To evaluate the constants, this result should be differentiated and $A$ and $B$ substituted into the rate equation describing $B$, as was done in the previous calculation. The initial conditions are normally $A=A_0$ and $B = 0$ at $t = 0$. As $B = 0$, then $c_1 = 0$ and, after substituting into the rate equation $c_2 = kA_0$, this makes\n",

    "\n",
    "Although rate constants for the reaction of different molecules can be the same, they are generally different. One situation where this is _not_ true is the unfolding of concatenated proteins by mechanical force. \n",
    "\n",
    "A concatamer is a macroscopic molecule made by attaching several identical folded proteins in tandem, just like beads on a necklace. The links between proteins consist of only a few peptides compared the the protein which may contain a 100 amino acids. When one end of the concatamer is anchored to a substrate and the other to the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM), the concatamer can be stretched by the AFM and each protein will unfold but in a random order with respect to its position in the concatamer (Reif et al. 1977; Brockwell et al. 2003). See Fig. 3.21 for a sketch of the experiment. The unfolding is registered by measuring the force and, to a good approximation, the unfolding rate constants for each protein are all the same. However, in this experiment, unlike normal chemical kinetics, the probability or chance $S$ that a protein is still folded at any given force is measured. If there are four proteins the reaction sequence is $\\displaystyle S_4 \\to S_3 \\to S_2 \\to S_1$ where $S_4$ is the chance that all proteins are folded, $S_3$ that three remain folded etc. _at a given force_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate constants $k_0$ of thermally induced chemical reactions are constant at fixed temperature and are the same for each protein because they are identical. In the mechanical pulling experiment, the rate constant depends on the force $f$, because the barrier to unfolding is lowered by the applied force (Bell 1978; Evans & Richie 1997). The rate constant also depends on how fast the force is applied, and the protein becomes stiffer, i.e. more force is needed to unfold it the faster the force is applied. This occurs because the barrier can be lowered more quickly than the average time between thermally induced protein fluctuations that lead to barrier crossing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unfolding rate constant is given by $\\displaystyle (k_0/L)e^{f/f0}$ where $f_0 =kT/x_u$ and $L$ is the load rate in pN s$^{-1}$. The constant $k_0$ is the (thermal) unfolding rate constant at zero force and $x_u$ is the distance from the minimum of the potential well to the top of the barrier separating the folded and unfolded protein. It is a measure of the distance the protein conformation has to change to reach the unfolding transition state and is typically $0.25$ nm. The unfolding forces are $100 \\to 300$ piconewton and $f_0 \\approx 15$ pN. Since all proteins are identical, and we assume that each protein experiences the same force irrespective of how many are folded or unfolded, the unfolding scheme for $N$ proteins can be written as\n",

    "\n",
    "In an NMR experiment, the sample is placed in a large permanent magnetic field aligned along the $z$-axis. The magnetic field splits the energy of the relevant nuclear spin states and if circularly polarized RF radiation of the correct frequency is applied this will cause transitions between the nuclear spin energy levels. The time and spatial evolution of the magnetization (the vectorial sum of the spin magnetic moments/unit volume) is described by the Bloch equations, which are basic to NMR (Flygare 1978; Günther 1992; Levitt 2001). The magnetization $M$ has components in the $x, y$, and $z$ directions and decays with a lifetime of $T_1$, due to longitudinal or _population_ relaxation and by $T_2$ transverse, or _spin-spin_, relaxation due to loss of spin coherence. See figure 13 for a sketch of the geometry of an experiment.\n",

    "The equilibrium magnetization is $M_0$ and the magnetic field can have components in the $x,y$, and $z$ directions, $B_{x,y,z}$. The Bloch equations describing the experiment are,\n",

In a normal NMR experiment, the magnetization is moved from the equilibrium position by the magnetic component of an RF pulse applied in the x - y plane. After the RF pulse has finished (defined as $t = 0$) the spins precess only in the external $B_z$ field starting with the magnetization where it ended up after the RF pulse ended. This will have components along the three axes of $M_x(0),\\; M_y(0)$, and $M_z(0)$. Because only $B_z$ is not zero, the Bloch equations are now simplified to\n",

This spirals around the z-axis at the Larmor frequency $\\omega$ until it reaches the equilibrium magnetization pointing along the z-axis, see Fig. 16.

It usual to make the transformation into the rotating frame which means that the axes are changed so that they rotate at the frequency of the R.F. radiation.

The initial position of the vector $M{(x,y}(0)$ must be defined also. $M_0$ was calculated as the length of the initial vector. In the figure the initial magnetization vector was at $(-1, -1 , 0)$.
