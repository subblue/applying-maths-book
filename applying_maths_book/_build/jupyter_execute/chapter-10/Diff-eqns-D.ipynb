The fact that all the rate constants are equal does not mean that the concentration of B is zero at all times, even though it is formed at the same rate as it decays. Taking the last result, it is not possible to make $k_1 = k_2$ because the concentration of B becomes undefined as 0/0, however, l'Hopital's rule could, in this case, be used to find the limit $k_2 - k_1 \\to 0$, (see Chapter 3.8).

    "### **(i) Atomic force microscope unfolding a concatenated protein**\n",
    "Although rate constants for the reaction of different molecules can be the same, they are generally different. One situation where rate constants are all the same is the unfolding of concatenated proteins by mechanical force. \n",
    "\n",
    "A concatamer is a macroscopic molecule made by attaching several identical folded proteins in tandem, just like beads on a necklace. The links between proteins consist of only a few peptides compared the the protein which may contain a 100 amino acids. When one end of the concatamer is anchored to a substrate and the other to the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM), the concatamer can be stretched by the AFM and each protein will unfold but in a random order with respect to its position in the concatamer (Reif et al. 1977; Brockwell et al. 2003). See Fig. 3.21 for a sketch of the experiment. The unfolding is registered by measuring the force and, to a good approximation, the unfolding rate constants for each protein are all the same. However, in this experiment, unlike normal chemical kinetics, the probability or chance $S$ that a protein is still folded at any given force is measured. If there are four proteins the reaction sequence is $\\displaystyle S_4 \\to S_3 \\to S_2 \\to S_1$ where $S_4$ is the chance that all proteins are folded, $S_3$ that three remain folded etc. _at a given force_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate constants $k_0$ of thermally induced chemical reactions are constant at fixed temperature and are the same for each protein because they are identical. In the mechanical pulling experiment, the rate constant depends on the force $f$, because the barrier to unfolding is lowered by the applied force (Bell 1978; Evans & Richie 1997). The rate constant also depends on how fast the force is applied, and the protein becomes stiffer, i.e. more force is needed to unfold it the faster the force is applied. This occurs because the barrier can be lowered more quickly than the average time between thermally induced protein fluctuations that lead to barrier crossing.\n",

The constant $k_0$ is the (thermal) unfolding rate constant at zero force and $x_u$ is the distance from the minimum of the potential well to the top of the barrier separating the folded and unfolded protein. It is a measure of the distance the protein conformation has to change to reach the unfolding transition state and is typically $0.25$ nm. The unfolding forces are $100 \\to 300$ piconewton and $f_0 \\approx 15$ pN. Since all proteins are identical, and we assume that each protein experiences the same force irrespective of how many are folded or unfolded, the unfolding scheme for $N$ proteins can be written as\n",

    "## 13.3 Bloch equations and NMR\n",
    "\n",
    "In an NMR experiment, the sample is placed in a large permanent magnetic field aligned along the $z$-axis. The magnetic field splits the energy of the relevant nuclear spin states and if circularly polarized RF radiation of the correct frequency is applied this will cause transitions between the nuclear spin energy levels. The time and spatial evolution of the magnetization (the vectorial sum of the spin magnetic moments/unit volume) is described by the Bloch equations, which are basic to NMR (Flygare 1978; Günther 1992; Levitt 2001). The magnetization $M$ has components in the $x, y$, and $z$ directions and decays with a lifetime of $T_1$, due to longitudinal or _population_ relaxation and by $T_2$ transverse, or _spin-spin_, relaxation due to loss of spin coherence. See figure 13 for a sketch of the geometry of an experiment.\n",

In a normal NMR experiment, the magnetization is moved from the equilibrium position by the magnetic component of an RF pulse applied in the x - y plane. After the RF pulse has finished (defined as $t = 0$) the spins precess only in the external $B_z$ field starting with the magnetization where it ended up after the RF pulse ended. This will have components along the three axes of $M_x(0),\\; M_y(0)$, and $M_z(0)$. Because only $B_z$ is not zero, the Bloch equations are now simplified to\n",

This spirals around the z-axis at the Larmor frequency $\\omega$ until it reaches the equilibrium magnetization pointing along the z-axis, see Fig. 16.

It usual to make the transformation into the rotating frame which means that the axes are changed so that they rotate at the frequency of the R.F. radiation.

The initial position of the vector $M{(x,y}(0)$ must be defined also. $M_0$ was calculated as the length of the initial vector. In the figure the initial magnetization vector was at $(-1, -1 , 0)$.

    "Our example is of delayed fluorescence of which there are two types. First the inter-molecular process of triplet-triplet annihilation which can produce a spin-statistically limited excited singlet state after two excited triplet states collide (Chapter 10, Q21) and the intra-molecular process of thermally repopulating the singlet state from the triplet and is called thermally activated delayed fluorescence or TADF. This latter process must have a triplet state only slighter lower in energy than the singlet if reverse crossing to the singlet, which is the process that produces delayed fluorescence, is to occur, see scheme fig 16a. The rate constant repopulating the singlet from the triplet is temperature dependent as $\\displaystyle k_r=k_r'e^{-\\Delta E/k_BT}$, there $\\Delta E$ is the energy gap, $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant and $T$ temperature in degrees Kelvin, see figure 16a. This rate constant and therefore the delayed fluorescence is highly temperature sensitive. The TAPD process is nowadays technologically very important as a process by which to improve the emission efficiency of molecules used as organic light emitting diodes OLEDs although the effect was observed decades earlier in the dye eosin by Parker and  Hatchard (Trans.

    "We know from our statement of the kinetics that the triplet is not present initially and must decay to zero at long times, and we can see from the form of these equations that the triplet population is indeed zero at $t=0$ and zero at $t=\\infty$ so must reach a maximum at some finite time and so is described by the difference of two exponentials.  The singlet decays from its initial value $S_0$ with an initial decay due to 'prompt' fluorescence and a longer decay due to re-population of $S_1$ from the triplet, causing the delayed fluorescence, so the singlet is expected to decay as the sum of two exponentials, as is confirmed by its equation. The two excited state lifetimes are \n",

    "The direct and delayed fluorescence, and the phosphorescence yields can be calculated by integrating the S and T decay profiles either analytically or numerically. Doing this for the rate constants used in the figure gave a direct fluorescence yield of $0.5$ and an additional delayed yield of $0.32$ which is a considerable increase. This may seem strange looking at the figure because the prompt fluorescence has decayed by so much before the delayed emission seems to start. However, the log time-scale is misleading and because this emission is present for such a long time, compared to the prompt fluorescence, and this makes its yield larger than it appears to be. The delayed fluorescence yield can also be worked out analytically, (C. Baleizao & M. Berberan-Santos, J. Chem. Phys, 2007, v. 126, p. 204510).  For the purposes of calculation they supposed that the energy moved sequentially from singlet to triplet  as $S^{(1)}\\to T^{(1)} \\to S^{(2)}\\to T^{(2)} \\cdots$ and worked out the chance of returning to the singlet at each step $1,2,3 \\cdots$, and so fluorescing at each. The initial chance is simply the fluorescence yield $\\phi_f$ but now a fraction $\\phi_i$ moves to the triplet and a fraction $\\phi_r$ of this returns and so the total chance so far is $\\phi_f(1+\\phi_i\\phi_r)$. At the next step only the fraction $(\\phi_i\\phi_r)^2$ returns and by induction $(\\phi_i\\phi_r)^3$ and so on for further steps, giving \n",

    "Consider two identical springs each _supporting_ a mass as shown in Fig. 17. This could be a simple model for part of a vehicle's suspension. The displacement from equilibrium of the upper mass $m_1$ is $y$, and that of the lower one $x$. The force constants are $k_1$ and $k_2$. If the springs were isolated, they would exert a force equal to $-k_2x$ or $-k_1y$ on their respective masses. When connected together, the upper spring now exerts a force equal to $-k_1(y - x)$ on $m_1$ as the displacement is changed by the lower spring. The total force on the lower spring is also changed and is $-k_2x + k_1(y - x)$. Together, these produce the force equations,\n",
