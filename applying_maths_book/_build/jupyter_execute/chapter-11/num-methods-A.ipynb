    "To start this chapter, some details on numerical accuracy are reviewed; next simple integration methods are described with a few examples and problems. More difficult, and interesting, is the numerical integration of differential equations, some of which only have numerical solutions. The various methods used are explained. A different numerical approach is taken in the next chapter on Monte Carlo methods. Simple integration is rather slow by this method but integrating differential equations is very robust. Monte Carlo methods are very versatile at simulating physical processes, such as diffusion or fluorescence, and occasionally this is the only way to do the calculation. Simulation also provides a good way to understand the processes involved, some of which can be very complex and not always easily translated into differential equations.\n",

    "In many calculations, the errors introduced by the computer due to the way its integers and real numbers are manipulated do not matter. Sometimes, the answer the computer returns may be precise and will be printed to many decimal places; however, it may not be accurate. To understand this, the expression $(1 - x)^6$ is expanded as the series \n",

    "$$\\displaystyle (1 - x)^6=1-6x+15x^2 -20x^3 +15x4 -6x^5 +x^6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and this is plotted close to its minimum at $x\\approx 1$ in Fig.1. While the scale is small, $\\approx 10^{-13}$, determining the exact root of the equation numerically is difficult. Of course, we know it is at $1$, but the computer will not give this answer even using a Newton-Raphson iterative scheme. The reason for the noisy plot is because the alternating positive and negative terms in the summation add up to almost zero, and the rounding error in the precision with which the numbers are calculated becomes important, and this limits the accuracy of the calculation.\n",

    "A real number is converted in the computer into a floating-point number represented as \n",

The mantissa, is the fraction $0.d_1d_2d_3d_4$, where $d_1$ etc. are the digits $0\\cdots 9$. A floating-point number is usually described as a single or double precision and the number of decimal places is typically $7$ and $14$ respectively; naturally this depends on the type of computer being used. Normally nowadays double precision is standard for example $17$ digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as seen in Fig. 1, $17$ digits are not good enough to find the root; $25$ decimal places give a far more accurate result. Using the Newton-Raphson method (see Chapter 3.10), the root cannot be found accurately: the method is "

    "With typical double precision ($16$ decimal places), the root found is $1.0030182818841857$, which is not even on the graph shown below, but furthermore it depends greatly on the starting value. If the function $(1 - x)^6$ is plotted directly without expanding, and hence without accumulating rounding errors, then the curve looks like that obtained with $25$ digits precision. This illustrates the important point that in many cases a small amount of algebra can significantly improve numerical calculations; errors rapidly accumulate with the repeated adding and subtracting of similarly sized numbers, and once an error is present it contaminates all subsequent results.  Python has the 'decimal' library to deal with higher precision and also there is a third party library called mpath.\n",

    "\n",
    "In summing a series, the number of terms to be added has to be decided in advance. This automatically leads to an error that is nothing to do with arithmetical precision. The calculation should be repeated with more terms until the number of decimal places you require is continuously obtained.

The value of $\\sin(0.5)$ is $0.47942553$ whether calculated directly using Python or as the summation up to the $x^7$ term. If, however, $x$ is large, for instance $x = 5.5\\pi$, then we know by drawing a graph that  $\\sin(x) = -1$, but by summation up to $x^7$ the result is $-79258.34$: clearly this is ridiculous because $\\sin(x) \\le 1 $ for all $x$. Only if the number of terms in the summation is increased to at least terms $\\gt x^{59}$, and the numerical precision increased to $20$ decimal places can an accurate result be obtained from the series approach. In this instance, we know that the answer from the small summation is incorrect because the properties of $\\sin(x)$ are well known, but if you are summing a series whose result is unknown, then great care is necessary.\n",

In the recursion calculation, $s$ has, arbitrarily, been chosen as the name for the integral because $I$ and $int$ are reserved names in Sympy. Recall that $\\mathtt{s= 1 - n* s}$; is an assignment, meaning that the new value of $s$ is $1 - n \\times (current\\; value)$. Some of the results are tabulated below the code, $n$ is the power to which $x$ is raised, $s$ is the recursion answer and $f(n)$ the result of algebraic integration.

    "You need to be aware that recursion can sometimes lead to chaotic behaviour as a normal outcome of a calculation.

    "There is an important distinction therefore to be made between different types of 'Chaos'. In classical and quantum mechanics, in studying molecules for example, it is also observed that regular motion can suddenly become chaotic even though the underlying equations of motion do not indicate that this will necessarily happen. By 'chaotic' is meant that two starting conditions placed arbitrary close to one another in value, will lead to entirely different but _repeatable outcomes_ at some later time. If the cause of the chaos is due to rounding errors, the outcome is not repeatable but unpredictable.\n",

As it does it rises rapidly, then oscillates before reaching a steady value.  However, at a value of $r\\ge 3$ bifurcation occurs, i.e. the oscillations persist indefinitely, and two values are alternately produced. As $r$ increases a little more, two periods are seen and four values exist, and these double again as $r$ continues to increase until eventually chaos ensues at about $r = 3.9$. Above $ r = 4 $, $x_n$ becomes negative, thus the valid range is $ 0\\lt r \\le 4$. Figure 1b shows this behaviour with an initial value of $x_0 = 0.1$.\n",

    "## 2.1 Secant method\n",
    "\n",
    "We now set aside the questions of numerical accuracy and chaos and look at some practical methods of numerically solving all sorts of equations. Sometimes in integration or in solving differential equations, the root of some function is required; three related numerical methods, the Secant, Regula Falsi, and bisection, are now described. The Newton - Raphson method has already been met in Chapter 3.10 and is used when the equation can be differentiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secant method is similar in idea to the Newton - Raphson method except that the derivative is expressed as a difference equation. If $f (x) = 0$ is the equation whose roots or $x$ values we want to find, then, in a recursive scheme, the next $x$ value is given by Newton - Raphson as \n",

    "and $f'$ is the derivative with respect to $x$. Notice how similar this equation is to the general form of the logistic map in the previous section, i.e $x_{n+1}=f(x_n)$.  The $x_0$ value to start the calculation must be somewhere near to the root, and can be estimated by plotting the function. At the end of each step, the new value $x_{n+1}$ is substituted into the right-hand side of the equation, and the process is repeated until the absolute value of the function becomes less than some preset tolerance or the number of iterations is exceeded.\n",
    "In the secant method, the derivative is approximated as\n",

Two initial guesses of the root are required, because the equation has to have points at $x_1$ and $x_2$ to begin the iterative process and these are usually to one side of the root. Once the method is close to a root, the number of digits of accuracy doubles for every two iterations.

    "## 3 Numerical integration\n",
    "Two methods of numerical integration have been briefly described in other chapters, one is the series expansion of a function and then a numerical evaluation of the terms; the other is the Euler - Maclaurin formula Chapter 5.7 and care needs to be exercised with both these methods. Three general and simpler methods are now outlined; these are the mid-point, the trapezoid, and Simpson's rule. More sophisticated numerical methods than these are described in Numerical Recipes (Prest et al. 1986) and similar specialized texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods divides the function to be integrated into small strips at predetermined abscissas, which are then multiplied by a certain constant number depending on the method, and added together. The integration becomes a summation, Fig. 3, and the general name for such a numerical integration method is *quadrature*. These methods are similar to the basic way we think about integration as the limiting area of a summation of rectangular strips as the width of each strip tends to zero. If the strips are fine enough, the result is a good approximation to the true value. In general, however, we do not initially know how many strips will be needed and some experimentation with this number is always necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be remembered that whatever numerical method is used, a polynomial is being integrated and not the original equation, and thus the ability of this to describe the curve will affect the results. The more sophisticated the method becomes, the higher the order of the polynomial used.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Drawing](num-methods-fig3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3. The trapezoidal rule approximates an integral with straight lines between points $x_1,\\, x_2,\\, \\cdots$, although not very well in this example, where the strips are too far apart to represent the function accurately. The mid-point method, on the other hand, evaluates the function half way between each point, three of which are shown by the vertical dotted lines.\n",
    "______\n",
    "## 3.1 Always try some algebra first\n",
    "There is always a tendency when using numerical methods to submit the equation directly to the computer. In many cases, however, performing some algebra first will help. This might mean simplifying the equation, removing constants to outside the integration, and, in particular, substitution of variables, which is done in standard integration. Consider the integral \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty (1+x^2)^{-1}dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This converges very slowly and makes the upper limit very large, which results in a slow calculation and potentially inaccurate numerical result. In fact, due to rounding errors, the result will get worse as the numerical integration proceeds. Some values of $1/(1 + x^2)$ are given in Table 2 and show that the maximum $x$ in the integration has to be at least $100$ for four-figure accuracy. This means that at least $1000$ points have to be used in the integration and even possibly $10,000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is needed is to transform the function into something less extended. The substitution $x = e^{uz} - 1$ where $u$ is a small constant will do this. This substitution is not immediately obvious by any means. Typically, $u = 5$, although this value is not critical. Differentiating $x = e^{uz} - 1$ gives $dx = ue^{uz}dz$, but the limits are still the same; $z = 0$ when $x = 0$ and $z = \\infty$ when $x = \\infty$. Making substitutions and simplifying a little makes the integral,\n",

If $z = 3$, the function in the integral has the value $\\approx 1.5\\cdot 10^{-6}$ making the whole expression virtually zero beyond this value, and so $3$ is the effective upper limit; quite an improvement on infinity. Additionally, fewer points in the integration are needed for the same precision.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mid-point integration assumes that the function is split equally into $N$ points, and any point is connected by a straight line to the next, thus ignoring any curvature between these points. Clearly, for a rapidly oscillating or varying function, many determinations of N will be needed to obtain an accurate answer. The mid-point method, not surprisingly, sums the values of the _function_ at the mid-point of each strip, $x_1^m \\; x_2^m \\cdots x_N^m $ as\n",

    "One advantage of this rule is that it enables functions with singularities in the integration range to be calculated. For instance, $1/(1 - x)$ is infinite at $x = 1$, but an integration spanning this point need not fail with the midpoint method but will do so with all other methods that calculate the function at integer increments of $h$.\n",

The size of this error is found by calculating two points $c$ where the second derivative has its maximum and minimum in the range $a \\le c \\le b$, and choosing the largest absolute value. This can be the most difficult part of the calculation and is usually not worth the effort. It is easier to calculate the integral by doubling the number of points each time until a sufficient number of decimal places are unchanging in the result. The mid-point method is the simplest to calculate and gives accurate answers, yet it is hardly mentioned in textbooks compared to the two methods described next. Notice that, because the mid-points are used, there is one less point in the summation using the mid-point method than in the trapezoid or Simpson's method described next.\n",

The exact value is $0.74682$ and the numerical value is $0.74690$ which is close and only used $20$ points in the integration, however, to obtain $5$ decimal place accuracy more than $100$ terms are needed."

    "\n",
    "Integrating a curve formed from data points obtained from an experiment has to be done numerically. The safest method is to draw straight lines between the data points and calculate the area as rectangles and triangles, which is what the trapezoidal method does, and this works even if the data is not evenly spaced. You might in addition want to fit the data by a least squares method, which has the effect of smoothing the data, integrating the resulting equation and comparing the results. Alternatively, fitting a polynomial to the data and then integrating may give the required solution.\n",

    "In this next extended example, more of a 'real world' rather than a purely mathematical calculation is described; it is the classical model of the elastic scattering of one particle, an atom or molecule, off another. The formulae are developed first, and then integrated using the Coulomb and Lennard-Jones 6-12 potentials, the latter being done numerically. In this example, the scattering angle is calculated. In a later example, the actual trajectory followed by a particle during elastic scattering is calculated and drawn.\n",

    "Geiger and Marsden performed one of the most famous scattering experiments during the first decade of the twentieth century. Alpha particles were passed through a very thin Au foil and the positions of these particles detected by scintillation counting after scattering off the Au atoms. In 1910, while at Manchester University, Rutherford deduced that the mass of the atom was not distributed like that in a raisin pudding throughout its volume, but concentrated at its centre in a very small dense nucleus, thus confirming a 'planetary' model of the atom. This laid the foundation for the old quantum (Bohr) model of the atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern version of this experiment, the nature of the force between two particles, such as atoms, molecules, or ions, is sought. A cold beam of atoms or molecules (particles) can be made by passing its gas through a small conical shaped aperture (a skimmer) into a region of high vacuum, typically $\\lt 10^{-6}$ torr. If the particles in one beam strike those in a second beam made in the same way, but at right angles, the particles can scatter off one another elastically. This scattering is not exactly like that of one snooker or billiard ball bouncing off another, but depends on the intermolecular potential energy between the particles. This may be mainly Coulombic if the particles are charged, but if neutral, then a Lennard-Jones potential better describes the interaction; see Fig. 30 (in solutions) for a graph of the potential. The angular position of the scattered particles can be used to calculate the form of the interaction potential. Nowadays detection of the particles' position is measured by a CCD camera with a scintillation plate in front of it. This converts a particle's kinetic energy into a photon. Alternatively, if this is not sensitive enough a specially designed particle detector has to be made and this moved from place to place to record the complete scattering pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry of the experiment is sketched in Fig. 4. The incident beam of particles, which has the shape of a cylindrical rod, is aimed towards the target atom. The potential energy between particles depends only on the separation of the particles; this is called a central force and the motion of the two particles about their centre of mass, can always be reduced to an equivalent one-particle problem, which means that the target can be considered to have infinite mass and therefore cannot move. If the incoming particles are initially off-axis they are deflected by the target and generally continue to travel away from their source but if they are more or less on axis they can be backscattered, orbit or sling-shot around the target.\n",

    "The incident particle starts at $-\\infty$ and a distance b off the axis, and has a total energy of $E_0$. The distance $b$ is called the _impact parameter_, Fig. 4, and is the distance by which the particles would miss one another if there were no interaction between them. The distance between the particles is the vector r, and the closest that they approach to one another is $r_0$. This minimum distance occurs in a repulsive potential at a distance greater than b, because the initial energy causes the incoming particle to rise up the potential 'hill' to an extent depending on its total energy. A more realistic potential, such as a Lennard-Jones 6-12, has both attractive and repulsive parts. The attractive part is usually more extended than the repulsive, so that the particles are attracted to one another at long range and repel at short range, consequently, the distance of closest approach can now be smaller than $b$. The particle has a final asymptotic angle $\\chi$ and the geometry shown in the figure gives this angle as\n",

    "A few points should be made about the calculation before considering the results. The integration is very tricky when the deflection angle is large and negative, because this angle can become $-\\infty$ and occasionally the integration will fail because here the square root becomes zero or imaginary. This can usually be avoided by adding a small amount to $r_0$ and $10^{-6}$ was found to be sufficient to prevent this and not significantly affect the results. The largest positive root is sought by calculating from the largest $r$, which can be taken to be the same as the largest $b$, to the smallest $r$, finding a change in sign and then starting the bisection method. This is necessary because the $r_0$ equation can have three roots when $b$ is large. The function $g$, equation 10 is a function of $r$ and $b$, and when the substitution is made, $r$ is replaced. The differential $dw$ also has to be substituted for $dr$, and this can be seen in the function ff.\n",

    "When the impact parameter $b$ is small ($b/\\sigma \\lt 1$), the recoil angle $\\chi$ is large and positive and the repulsive part of the potential is dominant. When $b$ increases, the overall deflection can become zero. This is called a 'glory' and the initial energy and values of $b$ mean that the particles are initially attracted to one another, but the impact angle is glancing and, as the repulsive part of the potential is reached, just enough repulsion is present to return the particle on to its original path; the attractive and repulsive interactions exactly cancel. Rainbow scattering occurs when $d\\chi/db = 0$ at the minimum of the curve shown in Fig. 6. At some $b$ values, the approaching particle can become captured, the angle increases past $-\\pi$ to $-\\infty$ and the particles orbit one another. This is seen with $E/\\epsilon = 1/5$ at $b/\\sigma \\approx 2.29$. The trajectories are shown in Fig. 10,  the algorithm with which to calculate them is also given.\n",

    "In actual experiments and in quantum calculations, interferences between the different paths the same particle can take are observed. These must be absent in any classical calculation. Scattering is observed experimentally by performing molecular beam experiments and the scattering is, fortunately, not always elastic and chemical reactions can occur and this is called _reactive scattering_. These experiments have provided lots of fundamental information about chemical reactions and there are a number of clear descriptions of this, see, for example, Rigby et al. (1986), Steinfeld et al. (1999), Bernstein (1982), Eyring et al. (1980), and Hirst (1990)."
