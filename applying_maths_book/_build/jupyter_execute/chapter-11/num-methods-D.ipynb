    "In the study of two-dimensional linear and non-linear differential equations, the phase plane, nullclines, and fixed points are very useful tools for analysing the equations before any numerical or algebraic calculation.

In practice, this means dividing the equation for $y$ by that for $x$; therefore the phase plane does not explicitly contain time. If the resulting equation can be integrated, the family of curves produced can be plotted for different values of the integration constant, which means for different initial values of $y$ and $x$. If the integration cannot be done analytically, then a numerical solution of the two initial equations has to be found and, again, $y$ plotted vs $x$ at various times until the entire phase plane is produced.\n",

    "### 6.2 Isoclines and nullclines\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation produced when the rate of change is zero is sometimes called an isocline or nullcline. Just as on an incline we move up, or on a decline down, an isocline means that the gradient is always the same and must therefore be a constant number, and a contour path is followed in the phase plane. A nullcline occurs when this constant is zero The nullclines are $x - x^3 = 0$ and $y = 0$, which in this case are both straight lines. Isoclines are the lines when $x - x^3 = a$ and $y = a$ where $a$ is some constant. Assuming that $y$ is plotted vertically and $x$ horizontally, the 'flow' or vector showing the direction of change, is always horizontal at each point along the nullcline, $dy/dt = 0$, no matter what its curve is, and vertical on the nullcline $dx/dt = 0$. The nullclines also partition the phase plane into areas where the derivatives have different sign; exactly what these are depends upon the particular equations. Figure  shows the phase portrait with isoclines at different $c$ values and the nullclines, which are dotted. The figure-of-eight curve is the _separatrix_ and, in this example, is the point when the particle has just enough initial energy to cross the barrier separating the region of oscillation in one well from motion over the barrier, and hence, motion between both wells. When the particle is placed in the bottom of either well, it has zero potential and zero kinetic energy. If it is not pushed, it will remain in this stable state at ($\\pm 1, 0$) which are the points on the axis marked with a red dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in this short introduction to the phase plane, it must be remembered that although the phase plane equation 37 does not explicitly contain time, $x$ and $y$ are still functions of time and that time passing on the phase plane is not measured by equal $x$ and $y$ motion, but in a very non-linear manner. This can only really be observed by plotting pairs of $x$ and $y$ coordinates on the phase plane at various times after solving the coupled equations.\n",

When the energy is small, it will oscillate about the vertical in a good approximation to simple harmonic motion, and when the energy is large enough it will rotate continuously in the vertical plane.

If the pendulum starts exactly upside down and also isn't given a push, i.e. initial angular velocity is zero, then it should remain upside down for ever in this metastable state. However, no matter what angle the pendulum is in initially, if it is given a sufficient push and acquires energy in excess of $2mgL$, then it can repeatedly rotate though 360$^\\mathrm{o}$.

The angle decreases as the pendulum moves towards its lowest point; this means that the velocity is negative and becomes increasingly so, reaching its largest negative value when the pendulum is pointing vertically down. The motion is therefore clockwise around the closed curves as shown by the arrows on the plot. The motion continues forever, because energy is conserved in this model of the pendulum.\n",

    "### 7 SIR model of the spread of diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "A very interesting, and relatively straightforward example of coupled equations is the spread of an infectious disease, because, besides being intrinsically interesting, especially during the Covid19 epidemic, it allows a clear illustration of a number of features such as the phase plane and nullclines. \n",
    "\n",
    "An epidemic is defined as the number of infected persons, increasing with time to a number above those initially infected. Kermack & McKendrick (1927), were the first to describe a realistic disease model, which they used to study the spread of a plague on the island of Bombay in 1905/6. In the SIR model, one or more infected persons are introduced into a community where all are equally susceptible to the disease. The model assumes, first, that the disease spreads by contact one to another; each person runs the course of the disease and then cannot be re-infected; and, secondly, that the duration of the infection is short compared to an individual's lifetime, so that the total number of people is constant. Finally, the number of individuals is fixed once the infection has begun; therefore this model only describes infection in a closed community and is called a compartmentalised model. This is called the S-I-R model, because individuals are either susceptible (S), infected (I), or removed (R). The scheme is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S+I \\overset{k_2}\\longrightarrow 2I ; \\qquad   I \\overset{k_1} \\longrightarrow  R  \\tag{40}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the aim is to calculate how R, S, and I change with time. In doing so we shall set up a set of rate equations and suppose that the numbers of individuals involved is sufficiently large that the integration is valid. In the case of Covid-19 the numbers are so large that this should not present a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step describes the transmission of the infection, and the second, the recovery from infection, hence, the number infected I must reach zero at long times as the infection ends. The susceptible persons become infected by reacting with someone who is already infected with a rate constant $k_2$. In chemical terms, the rate of such a second-order reaction is $k_2[S][I]$, supposing that $[S]$ and $[I]$ are concentrations. The second step, infected to removed, has a rate constant $k_1$, the reciprocal of which is the average time that an individual once infected takes to move into the removed class; the rate for this is $k_1[I]$. Out of the constant total number of individuals, $N = S + I + R$; the number $R_0$ before the infection starts are those that are immune and clearly at least one infected person has initially to be present. The second equation shows that given time, all individuals will end up in the removed class R, and play no further part in the infection, being immune, isolated, or dead. In this model, the epidemic is assumed to run its course without the intervention of medication, which, given at random times to different individuals, would prematurely cause its end.\n",
    "\n",
    "If S, I, and R were chemical species, the scheme above would represent a quadratic autocatalytic reaction where R is the product that takes no further part in the reaction. To start the reaction, some initial amount of species I has to be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Rate equations\n",

    "N &= I + S + R\n",
    "\\end{align}\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\text{41}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ and $I$ represent the number of individuals (or the concentration of chemical species in an autocatalytic reaction). The initial number infected is $I_0$, those susceptible $S_0$, and removed $R_0$. The total number of individuals is a constant $N$, and, because of this, the last differential equation is not needed because $R$ can be calculated by subtracting from $N$ the amount of $S$ and $I$ at any time. The rate constants are $k_2$, the spreading rate constant and $k_1$ the removal rate constant, and have units of number$^{-1}$ time$^{-1}$ and number time$^{-1}$ respectively. By writing down rate equations, it is implicitly assumed that the number of individuals present is large and can be a continuous variable, not an integer, as is really the case. The model described so far assumes that all infected persons recover but instead many may die as we have seen with Covid19. To model this an extra rate constant can be added to $k_1\\to k_1+k_D$ and then the term $dD/dt=k_DI$ included. The fraction that die is $k_1/(k_1+k_D)$, a number which will normally be known. Monte Carlo methods to integrate and simulate these equations without using calculus are shown in Chapter 12 in Q9 and Q16 and their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the equations are numerically integrated, a complete analytical solution not being possible, some analysis of the problem will be carried out. The actual values of the constants are important if a real disease is to be modelled, and before trying to fit the data, it is necessary to know what range of parameters will produce an epidemic and what the expected populations will look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the scheme 40 suggests that the number infected I, which is initially small (for instance, one person), increases rapidly, passes through a maximum, then slowly decays away. However, this will occur only if $k_2S_0 \\gt k_1$ because when S is large, I is initially formed more rapidly than it is consumed. If the opposite is true, then I is consumed more rapidly and its population cannot become large and no epidemic occurs. To be quantitative, let $R_R = k_2S_0/k_1$ be defined as the reproductive ratio,$^3$ which is the number of secondary infections caused by one infected person if all the population is equally susceptible. An epidemic must ensue if the reproductive ratio is greater than one, because more individuals will become infected with time. This can also be appreciated by examining the rate of change of I in the second of equations 41 at \n",

Time does not explicitly appear in this equation, but this does not mean that the curves are time independent; far from it, because S and I both depend on time. The curves, equation 42, must start at the line $S_N +I_N =1$ , or $S+I=N$, which is the diagonal line in Fig.16, because no $R$ (removed class) individuals are present initially, and must move to the left as time progresses. At very long times the fraction infected must become zero.\n",

    "The definition of an epidemic is that the number of individuals infected increases above those infected initially. In Fig. 16, the initial number infected is found where a curve touches the diagonal line, this is 0.25 with $S_0/N = 0.75$, and $I_N$ increases to $\\approx 0.4$ at its maximum and therefore, an epidemic may occur. Starting at $S_0/N = 0.25$, the number infected decreases continuously and therefore an epidemic cannot occur. This simple approach indicates the importance of immunization and vaccination. \n",
    "\n",
    "Immunizing or vaccinating a population reduces those susceptible, reducing $S_0$ and the reproductive ratio $R_R$, and so making an epidemic less possible. To the right of $S_N^{max}$, Fig.16, an epidemic occurs, although it may not be severe if the initial value of $S_0/N$ is close to the maximum; to its left the infection dies out. The turnover from epidemic to no epidemic is the point where $S_N^{max}$ touches the diagonal. In the figure this occurs at $I_N^{max} = 1 - 1/3 = 0.66$, meaning that $66$% immunization is needed to prevent an epidemic, which is a low value. With an infectious disease such as mumps or German measles, this value has to be $\\approx$ 0.85, meaning that 85% of the population has to be immunized to prevent an epidemic. Notice that not everyone needs to be immunized to prevent an epidemic; this is called *herd immunity*. A few individuals will by chance, never meet an infected person. An immunization/vaccination level of $85$% may be difficult to achieve in a population by voluntary mass vaccination. Should the level of immunization fall by only a small amount, the threshold at $S_N^{max}$ may be crossed and an epidemic could occur. The number of individuals being immunized can suddenly fall, as happened in the UK in the late 1990's and early in this century, due to poorly researched and inflammatory news media stories about the MMR vaccine for children. Some parents were reluctant to have their children vaccinated even though the risk of damage to health and even death were far greater than receiving the vaccine itself. Similar concerns have prevented many people from becoming vaccinated for Covid19 even though world-wide multiple millions of doses have been administered.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a rate equation, a steady state is produced when the rate of change is zero. In the SIR model this means $dS/dt = 0$ and $dI/dt = 0$. When molecules, or species in general, interact more than one steady state can be present, and not all of these are necessarily stable. The nullclines on the phase plane of the SIR model are particularly simple and are $I = 0$, or along the S-axis, and $S = k_1/k_2$, which is the vertical line at $S_N^{max}$ and divides the region where the infected population increases from that where it decreases. The nullclines divide the phase plane into four areas, two areas are below the S-axis in this case, and, as negative number of individuals do not make any sense, only two of the four regions have any meaning. Assuming that I is plotted vertically and R horizontally, the 'flow' or vector, arrow Fig.16, showing the direction of change is always vertical at any point of the $I$ nullcline, (horizontal axis), no matter what its curve is, and horizontal on the $S$ nullcline when $dS/dt = 0$. A steady state point is found where the nullclines meet, in the SIR model this is in the $S$-axis at the point $[k_1/k_2, 0]$ which is the foot of the vertical line $S_N^{max}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "To understand some of the equations above, such as the maximum fraction infected, $I_N^{max}$ it is easier to draw some graphs. Suppose that there are ten thousand susceptible persons, and that the disease starts to spread after one person is infected. What is the effect of the different rate constants? The rate of infection $k_2$ here is key, i.e. the term $k_2SI$ (eqn. 41) has a dramatic effect. If $k_2$ is small, $10^{-5}$, top left, (see the graphs below), the overall the epidemic does not progress even up to $1000$ days. However, with $k_2=2\\cdot 10^{-5}$ (top right) the epidemic starts and $\\approx 1500$ persons are infected at the peak. Increasing $k_2$ again to $5\\cdot 10^{-5}$  $\\approx 4800$ are infected. This rapid increase is rather dramatic and shows the effect of feedback, i.e. $ S+I \\overset{k_2}\\longrightarrow 2I $;  Increasing $k_2$ above $10^{-4}$ has a smaller effect than when $k_2=10^{-5}$ simply because so many are already infected. This behaviour shows how important the reproductive ratio is because this is proportional to $k_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with this simple model we can understand why wearing face masks is important because this effectively reduces $k_2$. Isolating individuals, or being vaccinated, reduces the spread of disease also because the number of those susceptible is reduced and therefore so is the product $k_2SI$ in eqn. 40. \n",

    "First, the timescale is in days; the number of boys susceptible is $763$, making $S_0 = 763 - 1$, assuming that only one boy was initially infected. If the infectious period is about 2.5 days, this means that, by definition, $k_1 = 1/2.5$, which can be used as a starting value leaving only $k_2$ to be estimated. We know that $R_R = k_2S_0/k_1$ has to be greater than 1 and if all the boys are susceptible except one,then $k_2 \\times 762 \\times 2.5 \\gt 1$ which makes $k_2 \\gt 5 \\cdot 10^{-4}$; the maximum value of $R_R$,is approximately 20 for common infections, making $k_2 \\lt 0.01$ and this should give a range of rate constants to start the calculation.\n",
