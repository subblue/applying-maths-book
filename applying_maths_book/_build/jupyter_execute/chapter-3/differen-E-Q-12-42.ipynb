    "$$ (a)\\; y=x^y,\\quad (b)\\; x=y^y,\\quad (c)\\; y=x^x$$\n",

    "If $y=x^2 +2,\\;x=\\sqrt{w},\\; w=\\cos(u)$, using the chain rule write down $dy/du$ in terms of $x,\\,u$, and $w$, then calculate the derivative in terms of $u$ alone. Confirm the result by substituting the equations first.\n",

    "If $\\displaystyle f = ye^{-ax}$ and $x$ and $y$ are both functions of a variable $s$, what is $df /ds$ if $a$ is a constant?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Being a function of $s$ means the functions are $y(s) =\\cdots$  and $x(s) =\\cdots$ or 'something in $s$'. In full notation $f (s) = y(s)e^{-ax(s)}$ . As both $x$ and $y$ are functions of the independent variable $s$, then the derivatives of $x$ and $y$ with respect to s must be found. It is here necessary to overcome our prejudice of $x$ as the only differentiation variable. If the equation had different symbols, it might be easier.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Notice that the derivatives are in time $t$ and distance $x$ and that they have to be connected; the way to do this is via the velocity.\n",

    "\n",
    "(c) Repeat the calculation by changing coordinates from Cartesian to Polar (see Chapter 1.7 for the definition of polar coordinates).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** In part (b), the tangent is horizontal when $dy/dx = 0$, and is infinite when $dx/dy = 0$. You will find $\\displaystyle \\cos^2(\\theta) - \\sin^2(\\theta) = \\cos(2\\theta)$ useful. The figure below is drawn in polar coordinates and the curve is rotated by $90^\\text{o}$ compared to that that would be drawn using Cartesian coordinates in part (a).

    "If $\\displaystyle y^2 = a^2 - x^2$ prove that $\\displaystyle y′′ = \\frac{a^2}{xy^2} y′$ where $y′′$ is the second derivative, $y′$ the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Start with the equation as written and either differentiate $y^2$ with respect to $x$ or take the square root first; either way will work, its your choice. This equation is that for a circle centred at the origin with radius $a$.\n",

    "### Q26 Differential operator\n",
    "If $D$ is the differential operator, this acts on a function $f$ to give the same function in return, $Df (x) = f (x)$, and where $f(0) = 1$. Repeatedly differentiate $n$ times and find $f (x)$ by using the Maclaurin series, which is \n",

    "\n",
    "where each derivative is evaluated at $x = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** The differential operator is a fancy name for $d/dx$ and therefore the equation is\n",

    "Show that $\\displaystyle u\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dt}$ if $u = dx/dt$.\n",

    "**Strategy:** Perform the differentiations in a rather formal way by using differentiation as an operator\n",

    "### Q30 Schroedinger eqn.\n",
    "The Schroedinger equation can be written with certain units so that $\\hbar^2/2m = 1$ producing $-D^2\\psi + V\\psi = E\\psi$ where the potential energy $V$ and wavefunction $\\psi$ are _both_ functions of $x$. The energy is $E$ and must always be independent of any coordinate. The operator $D = d/dx$. Verify that\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle \\psi D^4\\psi = D\\left(\\psi^2DV \\right) + (V - E)^2\\psi^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Look at the left-hand side of the equation that is to be verified, and work out what has to be done to the Schroedinger equation. Recall that $D$ means differentiate once, $D^2$ means twice, and that the operator only works on expressions to its right, and both $V$ and $\\psi$ are functions of $x$. Try to use the $D$ notation, if it proves too unfamiliar revert to using $d/dx$.\n",

    "### Q31 Reflection by a parabolic mirror\n",
    "(a) Find the equation of the tangent of a parabola with parametric equations $x = at^2$ and $y = 2at$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Using Fig. 8 as a guide show that a light ray parallel to the x-axis reflected off a parabolic mirror always passes through the focus F; the point ($a, 0$). Do this by finding the point P and the lengths PF and FT, and consider what happens when point T is varied.\n",

At high temperatures, expand the terms inside the integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** The heat capacity is the rate of change of energy with temperature and because the temperature is inside the integral, the differentiation can be performed inside the integral, and Leibniz's rule, equation (15) does not apply.\n",

    "The buffer capacity $\\beta$ of a weak acid - conjugate base buffer is defined as the number of moles of strong acid or base $C_B$ needed to change the $p$H by $\\pm 1$ unit, where\n",

    "\n",
    "(c) Differentiate $\\beta$. By ignoring the buffer concentration term, find the minimum value of $\\beta$ using $d\\beta/d\\text{pH}  = 0$. Next by ignoring terms not involving $C_B$ find the maximum $\\beta$. Justify these simplifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "( The equation for $\\mathrm{[B]}$ is obtained by making the total concentration $C_B=\\mathrm{[HA]+[A^-]}$ and using charge balance $\\mathrm{[A^-]+[OH^-] = [B^+] + [H^+]}$ where $\\mathrm{[B^+]}$ is the amount of base which is equivalent to the amount of, say, Na$^+$ present.

    "(b) What is the terminal velocity in miles /hour, if they weigh 60 kg and if $A  = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{ m^2}$? How long does it take to reach $95$% of the terminal velocity and how far will they have travelled vertically?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Calculate the terminal velocity for a hailstone weighing approximately $4$ g and of $10$ mm radius; comment on the relative speeds and energies of the skydiver and hailstone. If there were no air resistance what would happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) It is an urban myth, apparently, that a cat jumping out of a ten-storey window will survive the fall; you would almost certainly not.

    "(b) Is $\\sin(\\alpha x)$ a possible wavefunction?\n",

    "**Strategy:** The particular feature of note about eigenvalue - eigenvector equations is that the result of operating on a function is to produce the same function but multiplied by a constant. In the Schroedinger equation, the function is the wavefunction, the constant is the energy, and the operator is the kinetic plus potential energy operator $\\displaystyle - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V(x)$  and, for the sake of clarity, the constants in the question are in units such that they $\\hbar^2/2m =  1$ and also $V(x) = 0$.\n",

    "### Q40 Hooke's law\n",
    "Force is the derivative of the potential with extension. Hooke's law states that the restoring force is force constant $\\times$ extension so it follows that the potential energy is proportional to the bond extension squared, which is the harmonic potential. Using the Morse potential given in the previous question, show that the force constant $k$ near the bottom of the potential well, where Hooke's law applies, is $\\displaystyle k = 2D_e\\beta^2$.\n",
