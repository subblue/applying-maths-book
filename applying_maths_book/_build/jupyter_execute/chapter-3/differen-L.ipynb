    "When an equation depends on more than one variable, $x$ and $y$ perhaps, then it is possible to differentiate with respect to either $x$ or $y$ while keeping the other constant. The normal rules of differentiation apply; the only change is that the notation is a little different with a curly $\\partial$ being used instead of a Roman $d$ and a subscript is used to indicate which variable is held constant. If the function will allow it, second and third partial derivatives can be calculated.\n",

    "## 11.9 Partial Derivatives in Thermodynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "In the study of thermodynamics, partial, mixed, and total derivatives are commonly used; this adds to the complexity of the subject, particularly if these appear to be 'pulled out of fresh air'. Understanding how these relationships are produced really helps in understanding thermodynamics as it removes the mathematical burden, allowing the subject itself to be better understood. To this end, the parameters used in chemistry are $p,\\; V,\\; A,\\; T,\\; H,\\; U, \\;G,\\; S$ and each one depends upon the others. Besides $p,\\; V,\\; T$ and $S$, the other parameters used are $U$ the internal energy, $H$ the enthalpy, $G$ the Gibbs free energy and $A$ the Helmholtz free energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When one quantity is to be determined, for instance the entropy $S$, then it is defined provided it can be calculated as a function of _any other two parameters_. The two parameters chosen are normally determined by what can be measured experimentally; however, it can be shown that there are natural variables for each parameter; for the internal energy $U$ these are volume $V$ and entropy $S$. The defining equations for $H, \\;U,\\; G$, and $A$ in terms of natural variables are shown in table 1. When constructing equations involving thermodynamic derivatives as a rule of thumb, $'x'$ values are usually $T,\\; V,\\; p$, and $S$ and $'y'$ values $H,\\; U,\\; G,\\; S$, and $A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an _aide memoir_, the diagram below the table can be used to remember these equations. It is first necessary to remember the phrase 'Good Pupils Have Studied Under Very Able Teachers' with the first letter being the thermodynamic quantity. The rule is that to calculate $dG,\\;dH,\\;dU$ or $dA$ move to the two closest symbols and add + before the symbol if the move is to the right or up and negative otherwise. The other symbols are added according to the normal pairs. An example makes this clearer. To calculate $dA$ start with $dA= -?dV -?dT$ then as variables are always in pairs $p:V$, $S:T$ etc., then $dA=-pdV-SdT$\n",

However, the amount of _work_ done to achieve this need not be the same. Another state function is gravitational potential energy, which is the energy gained on climbing a hill.
