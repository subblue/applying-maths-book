    "### 6  l' Hopital's rule\n",
    "In many calculations limits are encountered. For example, in the theory of diffraction the function $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$ is met which, when $x \\to 0$, has the form $0/0$ and at first sight this ratio seem to be indeterminate. There are other forms similar to this such as $\\infty/\\infty,\\, \\infty/0,\\, 0\\times \\infty,\\, 0\\times 0,\\, \\infty-\\infty$ and l'Hopital's rule is a method, sometimes used with a little additional ingenuity, of determining these limits. This topic is discussed here, not only because it requires differentiation, but also because it will be needed in the next section. It seems that Johann Bernoulli first worked this out, but it is named after l'Hopital who was one of his pupils.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Rearrange the limit required, if necessary, so that it becomes a ratio. This may require some cunning.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Differentiate top and bottom separately with respect to the limit variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Substitute in the limit and check if the ratio is still indeterminate. If it is return to (b) if not the answer has been found.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example should make this clearer; the ratio $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$ appears to be $0/0$ as $x \\to  0$ but it has a finite value which is determined using l'Hopital's Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle  \\lim_{x\\to o} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\to \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}\\sin(x)}{\\frac{d}{dx}x}=\\frac{\\cos(x)}{1}=1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the limiting value of $x = 0$ is only applied in the last step. As a check, one way to determine any limits close to zero is to plot the function. You will see that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$ does indeed have a value of 1 at $x = 0$. See question 47 for other examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions such as $\\displaystyle \\frac{e^x-1}{x^2}$ often need to be evaluated when $x \\to 0$ or $x \\to \\infty$. In statistical mechanics, for example, $x$ may be $-E/k_BT$, a ratio of energies where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ temperature. When $x \\to 0$, which corresponds to high temperatures, the function $\\displaystyle(e^x - 1)/x^2$ appears to have the indeterminate form $0/0$, but the limit by l'Hopital's is\n",

    "\n",
    "where differentiation was performed twice over.  However, this is _wrong_: no check for an indeterminate  ratio was made after the first differentiation and doing this gives, \n",

    "\n",
    "The other limiting case $x \\to \\infty$ is also infinity: note that after the first differentiation checking the ratio gives $\\displaystyle \\frac{e^x}{2x} = \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}$ so indeterminate and so continue to differentiate again\n",

    "\n",
    "The limit $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{e^{-x}-1}{x^2-3}$  can perhaps be appreciated by looking at the ratio and noticing that when $x$ is large $e^{-x}$ becomes small but $x^2$ large so the limit is expected to be zero. Checking this properly gives the same result as intuition:\n",
    "\n",

As each emitter radiates over all $4\\pi$ angles only at certain values of these angles do the waves add up, i.e. they are in phase and so form a maxima and the equation describes how the intensity changes with phase. See Chapters 9 & 10 of 'Optics' by Hecht & Zajac (1982).\n",

    "When $N=1, I=I_0$ and when $N=2,I=4I_0\\cos^2(\\delta/2)$, but what is the maximum intensity for any $N$? To find this we can use l'Hopital's rule with $\\delta=2m\\pi,\\;m=0,\\pm 1,\\pm 2\\cdots$ meaning that the phase difference must be equivalent to a whole number of wavelengths for the intensity to be at a maximum.

    "### 6.1 Beware of 'False fractions'\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a limit is required but the expression is not really a fraction, for example $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 1} \\frac{x^4-1}{x-1} $ which looks like a fraction but is simplified to $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x\\to 1} \\frac{(x-1)(x^3+x^2+x+1)}{(x-1)} $ and because the value $x = 1$ is never reached ( we are seeking the limit to not the value at $x = 1$) the $x-1$ terms can be cancelled out leaving $\\lim_{x\\to 1} (x^3+x^2+x+1)=4 $\n",

    "### 7 Extrema: maxima, minima and inflection points\n",
    "\n",
    "One very useful property of derivatives is that they allow us to find the maxima and minima of functions; these are also called stationary points of the function. The extrema might be the maximum or minimum but can also be the limit where the function goes to $\\pm \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum of a curve is a point in whose locality all surrounding points have smaller $y$ values. The minimum is defined similarly but points adjacent to it have larger y values and in both case the gradient is exactly zero. In Fig. 12 it is clear that the gradient is zero at the maximum and again at the minimum of the curve. The graph shows the first $f'$ and second $f''$ derivatives. An inflexion point can occur when the gradient is zero but $y$ is smaller on one side of the point than it is on the other. An inflexion can also occur when the gradient is not zero in which case the curvature of the line changes from concave to convex or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first derivative is zero at $x$ = 4/3 and 3, which are the maximum and minimum respectively. The second derivative, which is the straight line, is negative at the maximum and positive at the minimum, so that the maximum and minimum of a function can be found from knowledge of the first and second derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function shown in Fig. 12 is the equation $y = 2(x - 2)^3 - x^2 + 4$, which has three roots, where $x = 0$ at $x \\approx 0.8, 2$, and $\\approx 3.7$. The first derivative is $y' = 6(x - 3)(x - 4/3)$, which has roots at $x = 4/3$ and $3$, which from the graph (left) are the maximum and minimum. The second derivative $y'' = 12x - 26$ is negative where $x \\lt 13/6$ ($\\approx 2.2$) as can also be seen from the graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many non metallic compounds such as ZnS-Cu and zinc silicates-Mn, will show phosphorescence lasting many tens of seconds after excitation with UV light. Some phosphors also show luminescence on heating and this provides a method of dating minerals and clays directly or in man-made objects discovered by archaeologists. The cause of the luminescence is the recombination of electrons, liberated by the UV or heat, with relatively low energy impurity 'traps' and the excess energy is released as a photon. These impurity traps have an energy between the filled levels (ground state or valance band) and the empty ones at higher energy (excited state or conduction band). \n",

At low temperatures no electrons have the energy to surmount the energy barrier making the luminescence zero. At very high temperatures all the electrons have enough energy to reach a trap and no more are left to luminesce and so again the intensity is zero.  This is important when this method is used to date pottery or other artefacts because heating sets the 'clock back to zero' by allowing all electrons to recombine with traps. Thermally and/or by exposure to light the electrons are released and so the material can luminesce again. This provides a way of dating.  \n",

    "Instead of finding the maximum or minimum of a curve, consider finding the shortest distance between two points on the earth's surface or on a cone, or finding the equation giving the minimum area of a surface, or the curve of fastest descent between two points. The _Calculus of Variations_ allows us to work out solutions to problems of this type.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine a graph that shows the many possible different curves that will fit between any two points. A practical example would be all the different routes by which you could travel from, say, Paris to Berlin.  The calculus of variations is so named because it varies any path by an amount $\\delta y$ and, as the variation, $\\delta y \\to 0$, the path along $y$ becomes the same as that along $y + \\delta y$. Because the whole path is sought, the problem is to find a function $f$ that, provided that it exists, will make an _integral have a stationary_ value, also called an _extremal_, which usually means that it has the smallest possible value.

    "The Brachistochrone is the name of the curve a frictionless particle will travel along to pass between two points in the shortest time when acted on by a force such as gravity. The time taken is much less than that taken to move down a straight slope or, in fact, any other slope. The Tautochrone is the same curve but is used to describe the fact that a particle set in motion down the curve will arrive at the horizontal part at the same time irrespective of where it starts from. The inverted Brachistochrone is the cycloid, see question 53.\n",

    "As it will simplify the calculation, we will suppose that a particle of mass $m$ travels downwards in the +$x$ direction and moves to the right as the +$y$ direction after starting at rest at the origin (Margenau & Murphy, 1943). Using conservation of potential and kinetic energy,\n",
