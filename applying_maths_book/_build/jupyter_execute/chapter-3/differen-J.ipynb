    "### 10 Lagrange Multipliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrange multipliers are used in statistical mechanics where they help in deriving the Boltzmann distribution; you may also come across them in minimizing the energy in a Hartree - Fock, self-consistent field (SCF) quantum chemistry calculation but they can be used in less exotic situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Undetermined multipliers appear in these very complex problems and you would therefore be forgiven if you thought that this method was extremely difficult, but it is not. It is instead, a very clever idea to solve a problem that has _constraints_. A constraint is a limitation imposed on a solution to a problem for example, 'find the shape of a cylindrical can that maximizes its volume, but uses as little material as possible'. Alternatively, the constraint might be to find the best length to diameter of an animal's leg bone that has to withstand running or jumping without breaking, and still be as light as possible; or simply find the shortest distance from a point to a curved line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a maximum or minimum quantity is sought, differentiation is involved. However, in these problems, there are _two functions_, one is the constraint and the other the function that is to be maximized or minimized. By differentiating both expressions, the function and constraint we find their tangents which will probably not have the same value. The undetermined multiplier, conventionally called $\\lambda$, scales these tangents to be the same. Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\text {differential ( Function) + }\\lambda \\text{ differential ( Constraint ) = 0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In using this method, $\\lambda$ is found first, then the $x$ and $y$ values of the minimum or maximum. Of course, if there is more than one constraint there is an undetermined multiplier for each.\n",

    "The convention is that $f(x, y)$ represents the function, $g(x, y) = 0$ the constraint, and $\\lambda$ the multiplier. The new function $Q$ we have to solve is\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle  Q(x, y, \\lambda) = f(x, y) + \\lambda g(x, y) \\tag{36}$$ \n",

    "An example shows how this algorithm works. \n",

    "#### **(i) Distance to a point**\n",
    "Suppose you are set the problem to find the shortest distance from any point $(x_0, y_0)$, which could be the origin $(0, 0)$, to the Gaussian curve $\\displaystyle y = e^{-x^2}$, see fig 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** The Gaussian exponential defines the constraint, which means that the points we find must lie on this curve, and therefore $g$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle g(x, y) = y - e^{-x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function to minimize is the distance from $(x_0, y_0)$ to a point $(x, y)$ on the curve and this is calculated using Pythagoras' theorem,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle f(x,y)=\\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}  \\tag{38}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The point $(x_0, y_0)$ is made the origin (0, 0) at the end of the calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Differentiating both $f$ and $g$ with respect to $x$ and to $y$ produces\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{df(x,y)}{dx}&=-\\frac{x-x_0}{\\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}}, \\qquad \\frac{dg(x,y)}{dx}=2xe^{-x^2} \\\\\n",

    " \n",
    "**(d)** Substituting $\\lambda$ into the first of the two equations in (c) gives, after some simplification,\n",

    "**(e)** The quantities $x_0$ and $y_0$ are constants in the last equation, which can be solved to find $x$ and then this substituted into our function $y = e^{-x^2}$ to obtain $y$. The distance from the origin with $x_0 = 0$ and $y_0 = 0$ to the curve is found by solving $\\displaystyle -1+2e^{-2x^2}=0$ giving $\\displaystyle x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{2}} =\\pm 0.5887$ and $y=1/\\sqrt{2}$ as the coordinates of the shortest distance, see Fig. 30. This distance itself is found by substituting into $f (x, y)$, equation (38), and is $(\\ln(2) + 1)/2 \\approx 0.92$.\n",

    "#### **(ii) Object -  image distance in a thin lens**\n",
    "In this second example, the closest distance an object can be to its image, when using a thin lens, is found. The lens has a focal length $f$, the object is at a distance $u$ before, and the image $v$, after the lens. \n",
