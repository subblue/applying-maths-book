The value of the cosine at any point is the gradient of the sine at that point and the gradient of the cosine is $-1$ times the value of the sine. When the sine has its maximum or minimum, where the gradient is zero, the value of the cosine is also zero. Furthermore, when the gradient of the sine is positive, $x/\\pi = 0 \\to 1/2$ and also $3/2 \\to 2$, the value of the cosine, which is the derivative, is positive. When the gradient of the sine is negative, the value of the cosine is negative.

A tangent, for example, is the ratio of sine/cosine and is treated as a ratio. Others functions such as sec(x) which is 1/cos(x) can be treated as a function of a function, Section 5.1, either in the trig or exponential form.
