# ## Q10 Roots
# Find the four roots of $(-3)^{1/4}$.
# 
# **Strategy:** This problem is the same as solving the equation $w^4 = -3$ and as there are four roots they must form a square on an Argand diagram whose corners lie on a circle of radius $3^{1/4}$. The roots of a negative number are sought so these must all be complex with a zero real part; i.e. with an imaginary part only.
# 
# ## Q11 Square roots
# Find the square roots of $i$, i.e. $w^2 = i$. Find their magnitude and plot them on an Argand diagram.
# 
# ## Q12 Solve eqn.
# Solve $w^4 = 16$.
# 
# **Strategy:** Because the equation is fourth order, there are four solutions and not just the two real ones $w = \pm 2$. Use the method of previous questions.
# 
# ## Q13 Modulus & argument
# Calculate the modulus and argument of $2 + 3i$ then calculate its square roots. What is the radius of the circle on which the roots lie and at what angles?
# 
# **Strategy:** The complex number $2 + 3i$ is best converted into its trigonometric form to calculate the modulus and argument.
