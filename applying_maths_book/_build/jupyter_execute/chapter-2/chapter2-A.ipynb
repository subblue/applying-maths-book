    "## 1 Motivation and concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers arise naturally in mathematics, often when solving quadratic equations such as $x^2+x+1=0$, which has the solutions \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle x=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{-4}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}1 \\pm \\sqrt{-1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the negative square root cannot be evaluated, as no ordinary number can be negative when squared, a new number conventionally called $i$ (although engineers call this $j$) was invented with the property $i^2 = -1$  or $i = \\sqrt{-1}$. The solution to the equation becomes $x = 1/2 \\pm i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new number is one of a new class called _complex numbers_. These are not numbers in the elementary sense used in counting or measuring, but constitute new mathematical objects and have an existence of their own. These numbers are called 'complex' only because they contain two parts and can always be written in the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle z=a+ ib \\qquad\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is called the _real_ (Re) part and $b$ the _imaginary_ (Im) part of the number. The complex number $z = i$, if written in the form of equation 1, has a real part $a = 0$ and an imaginary part $b = 1$. The latter is rather a misnomer as $b$ is just as 'real' as is $a$; it is just a number and perhaps, therefore, the best way to view a complex number is to consider it a number in two dimensions with amounts $a$ and $b$ in each of these dimensions. In that case, a complex number can be represented as a point on a graph rather than being a point on a line, as a normal number may be considered to be. The graph is called an Argand diagram, if drawn with the real part $a$ along the conventional x-axis and $b$ along the y-axis; the area defined by $a$ and $b$ is also called the Argand or Gauss plane. The imaginary number $i$ has a real part that is 0 and an imaginary part that is 1, and is represented by the point (0, 1) on the y-axis of an Argand diagram, see figure 1.\n",

    "_____\n",
    "\n",
    "The Argand diagram is not like a normal graph in which a function such as $y = x^3$ is plotted, because the value of $y$ on the graph normally shows how large the function is at a given value of $x$. The Argand diagram shows one point in the real and imaginary plane for each complex number so is more like a map that locates a place with latitude or longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing algebra with complex numbers is no more difficult than with 'normal' numbers, because the prime rule of algebra still applies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad\\qquad$'*Whatever I do to one side of an equation I do to the other side*'\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal rules for addition and multiplication apply but with the additional rule that additions and subtractions are kept separate for the real and imaginary parts, as is done for components of vectors. A complex number can be divided in the usual way by a real number. Dividing by a complex number has the additional step that the top and bottom of the expression are first multiplied by the complex conjugate of the denominator. This is explained below. Although $i$ is a complex number, $i^2 = -1$ and is a real number:\n",

    "In quantum mechanics, the wavefunction is often found to be a complex quantity and, therefore, the complex conjugate is always used to calculate expectation or average values such as $\\langle x \\rangle = \\int\\psi_i^* x\\psi_f dx$ and probabilities $p = \\int \\psi^*\\psi dx$ because only a mathematically real quantity is measured in an experiment, not an imaginary one.\n",

    "In some textbooks and some scientific papers, formulae involving complex numbers are written in a form that does not include the complex conjugate but instead has the notation +c.c. at the end of the equation to indicate that the complex conjugate is to be added.

An alternative is to use $\\mathtt{z.real,\\; z.imag}$ or $\\mathtt{z.conjugate()}$ (notice brackets) as shown below.
