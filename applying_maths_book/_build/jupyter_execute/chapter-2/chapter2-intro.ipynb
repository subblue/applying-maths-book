    "Complex numbers are an integral part of mathematics and are therefore often met in physical chemistry. At a practical level they are needed to understand fourier transforms (Chapter 9) and are used in describing NMR and x-ray diffraction from crystals as well as practical things such as MRI and CT scanners. Complex numbers also appear naturally in Quantum mechanics. You can think of a complex number as a two dimensional number which follow special and simple rules. This chapter introduces them with examples of their use."
