    "### 4.2 Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's formula is important in science, because it permits the description of a sinusoidally varying real quantity by means of complex exponentials as in Fourier Transforms described in Chapter 9. This change simplifies equations, because it is far easier to manipulate exponentials than trig functions. For example, the general form of a sinusoidally varying quantity, such as a plane wave, is $f (t) = a_0\\cos(\\omega t - \\theta)$, where $a_0$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ the frequency, and $\\theta$ the phase. These are all constants, and $t$ is time and is a real variable. The equivalent complex function is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle g(t) = a_0e^{i(\\theta-\\omega t)} = a_0\\left(\\cos(\\omega t - \\theta) - i \\sin(\\omega t - \\theta)\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "therefore $f(t) = Re(g(t))$. Very often in chemistry and physics, the complex form is used without explicitly stating that it is only the real part that represents the waveform. Figure 7 compares these waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of using Euler's equation, we will evaluate $w = \\ln(-1)$ even though it doesn't exist as a pure real number, then calculate $w = \\ln(i)$ and $w = \\ln(z/3)$, where $z$ is any complex number. The strategy in problems of this type is to convert the number $-1$, or $i$, or whatever it is into an exponential form using Euler's theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i)** In the first example, $w = \\ln(-1)$ or $e^w = -1$ and $w$ has to be found to solve this equation. A general complex number can always be written as $z = re^{i\\theta}$, therefore to find $w$, let $w = i\\theta$. The absolute value (modulus) $r$ of $e^w$ is $e^{i\\theta}e^{-i\\theta} = 1$. Because $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i \\sin(\\theta)$, when $\\theta = \\pi$, $e^{i\\theta} = -1$ making the principal value of $\\ln(-1) = \\ln(1e^{i\\pi}) = i\\pi$, which, obviously, is a complex number. Note that there are other values of $\\theta$ separated by $2k\\pi i$, where $k$ is an integer because $e^{i\\theta}$ is a cyclic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(ii)** Suppose $w=\\ln(i)$ or $e^w =i$. Let $w=i\\theta$. As $e^{i\\theta} =\\cos(\\theta)+i\\sin(\\theta)$,when $\\theta = \\pi/2$ this equation produces $e^{i\\pi/2} = i$ or $\\ln(i) = i\\pi/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(iii)** If $w = \\ln(z/3)$, then $3e^w = z$, and if $z$ is any complex number then we look for a value of $\\theta$ such that $3e^{i\\theta} = z$. Generally a complex number is represented by $z = re^{i\\theta}$, then in this example $w = \\ln(z) = \\ln(3e^{i\\theta}) = \\ln(3) + i(\\theta + 2\\pi k)$ and $2\\pi k$ is added because the function is cyclic and $k$ is any integer; recall that the Euler equation can be put into a cosine and sine form, so it is a repetitive function. The principal value occurs when $k = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to example (i), $w = \\ln(-1)$, if the $-1$ is treated as a complex number with an imaginary part that is zero, then the answer can be written down directly as $w = \\ln(-1) = \\ln(re^{i\\theta}) = \\ln(1) + i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)$\n",
    "and, since $r = 1$ and $\\ln(1) = 0$, this gives the same result as in (i) $\\ln(-1) = i\\pi$ for the principal value.\n",

    "**(iv) x-ray scattering intensity. The Structure Factor** \n",
    "In chapter 9, (Fourier Series and Transforms) and in section 13.6, x-ray diffraction by a single crystal is described. The scattering factor $F$ described how the intensity of a given 'reflection' is related to the coordinates of the atoms in the unit cell _via_ the Miller indices $( h k l )$ of the planes of atoms. The Miller indices are integers that can be positive, zero or negative. The planes of atoms occur because the unit cell is repeated throughout the crystal to form a lattice of points. The unit cell is the smallest arrangement of atoms from which the whole crystal can be constructed. \n",

    "\n",
    "where subscript $i$ refers to atoms $i$ in the unit cell. The values $u, v, w$ are the atom positions as *fractions* of the sides of the unit cell. The intensity of the diffracted spot is $I=|F|^2=F^*F$  which means that the series of terms in $F$ has to be multiplied by its complex conjugate. The term $f_i$ is the atomic scattering factor for each type of atom relative to that of a single electron. It is the electrons in an atom that predominantly scatter the x-rays and so $f_i$ is proportional to the number of electrons, so is larger for heavy atoms than light ones. See Chapter 9-13.6 for details. Notice in particular that the structure factor *does not depend on the shape of size of the unit cell*, but on the fractional positions of the atoms.\n",

Thus when $h+k$ is an even number $F=2f$ and when it is not $F=0$. The value of $l$ has no effect thus refections from indices, for example, $131, 132, 133$ etc. all have the same intensity, and similarly $122,123,124$ etc. are all missing with zero structure factor.\n",
