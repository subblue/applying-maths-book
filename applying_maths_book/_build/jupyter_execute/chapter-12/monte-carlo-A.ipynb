    "## 1.1 Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a Monte Carlo method to numerically integrate a function, the area corresponding to the integral is calculated by repeatedly guessing pairs of $x$ and $y$ values at random and evaluating the function $y = f (x)$ to see whether or not $y$ lies within the area bound by the integral, Figure 1. Clearly many guesses will be needed and while many will fall inside the required region, many will not. The ratio of correct guesses to the total number is proportional to the integral. The more guesses that are made, the closer the answer becomes to the true value. The error can then be estimated and the calculation truncated when a satisfactory result is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two considerations. First, the computer generated random numbers must actually be random, or as near random as possible. These are usually described as being pseudo-random. The randomness of numbers is a complicated issue, but if Python and similar programs are used, then the (pseudo) random number generators can be relied upon; (Prest et al. 1986 give details about random number generators.) Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator,which produces 53-bit precision floats and has a period of $2^{19937}-1$ which is a number about 6000 digits long. The second consideration is that numbers should be taken from a uniform distribution. A uniform distribution is one in which the chance of obtaining any number in a given range, which may be 0 to 1 but is normally $a$ to $b$, is the same no matter where the number is in that range. In other distributions, this is not true; a Gaussian distribution has more chance of returning a number near to its mean value than elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 explains the Monte Carlo integration method. The integral is $Q = \\int_a^b f(x)dx$. Two uniformly distributed random numbers are chosen; one $R_x$ between $a$ and $b$ and another $R_y$ between limits $f(c)$ and $f(d)$, where the points $c$ and $d$ must be chosen to include the minimum and maximum of the function in the range $a$ to $b$. A large number of pairs of points are chosen, those for which $R_y \\le f(R_x)$ are found and then counted up. The integral is approximated as\n",

If the function is $f (x) = x^2$, and $R_x$ and $R_y$ are random guesses in the range $a \\to b$ in $x$, and $a_2 \\to b_2$ in $y$, respectively, only if $R_y \\le R_{x^2}$ is the point counted as being within the function. This approach is clearly rather wasteful; less than half of the points fall within the area for $x^2$ although this is better for an ellipse, because most of the ellipse fills the rectangular area. In practice, this method, while easy to implement would never be used; the mean-value method described next works far better and involves only a little more analysis.\n",

    "The function $\\sin^2(1/x)$ is symmetrical about $x = 0$ and oscillates ever more rapidly as it approaches zero; see Figure 2. The integral has no algebraic solution but one that involves the sine integral, which has to be evaluated numerically. The integral can, however, be estimated by the Monte Carlo method without using any algebra. The range of $y$ is $0 \\to 1$, because the maximum of the function is 1, and we choose $x = 0 \\cdots 2$ so that two random numbers in these ranges are needed. The area of the integration box is $A = 2$ because the $y$ range is 1. The Monte Carlo method equation 1 is illustrated below. The random number is called using numpy/python function $\\mathtt{np.random.ranf()}$ as this generates a floating point number in the range $0 \\to 1$. This is then adjusted to fall in the range of the $x$ and $y$ limits as $R_x$ and $R_y$ respectively. The method works by adding one to the total $s$ if the function at $R_x,(\\; f(R_x) )$ is greater than $R_y$.\n",

The trapezoidal or Simpson methods are generally more efficient (see Chapter 11.3.3 and 11.3.4), but in this case the rapid oscillations require that these methods also have to use a large number of points. The following algorithm will evaluate an integral of the function and its standard deviation, which is calculated as shown in equation 2. The average values are multiplied by the $x$ range $\\mathtt{xlim_b - xlim_a}$ as in equation 3. The answer obtained for this integral depends on the actual calculation as for all Monte Carlo methods.

    "## 1.3 Non-uniform distributions: Importance Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to imagine functions that are large in only small regions of $x$ and are virtually zero elsewhere; the bell-shaped Gaussian curve being one example. So far a uniform random number distribution has been used to numerically evaluate an integral, but this can waste a lot of effort by repeatedly calculating contributions to the integral that are effectively zero. In some instances, an incorrect result may even be obtained with this approach, see for example Krauth 2006. A better method is to use a non-uniform distribution to bias sampling and to add in more of those values that have a large contribution to the integral, and less of those that do not. This is sketched in the figure where many samples are taken where the function is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simulating a number of physical processes, such as the mean energy of an oscillator at a given temperature, or of an array of spins whose energies are distributed by the Boltzmann distribution, and many other examples in statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics, a biased sampling method, called the Metropolis Algorithm is used. This is described in Section 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Monte Carlo sampling, the standard deviation is reduced as $\\sigma =Q/\\sqrt{N}$ for $N$ samples and $Q$ is a constant that depends on the particular problem being solved. Increasing the number of samples $N$ will obviously reduce the standard deviation, but only slowly; additionally $N$ may in practice be limited, because it is proportional to the time the computer takes to do the calculation. However, it turns out that importance sampling can reduce $Q$ and therefore $\\sigma$ by carefully selecting where the samples are taken. This can be done if the function being integrated is changed to another that is effectively 'flatter'. Suppose, therefore, that the integral is multiplied by $p(x)/p(x)$ which is 1, and written as\n",

The remaining $p(x)$ is converted into a normalized distribution function to provide values of $x$ distributed as $p^{-1}$. The _inverted distribution_, which we shall call $t$, is $t = p^{-1}(r)$ and $r$ is a random number in the range $0 \\to 1$. The choice of $p$ is limited to functions that can easily be inverted, such as $e^{-x}$; otherwise, a numerical way of inverting the function has to be used which will involve a lot of unnecessary calculation.\n",

The Gaussian $e^{-x^2}$ is an obvious choice but this can only be inverted numerically, such as with the Box - Muller algorithm (Weisstein), and therefore we will instead try $p(x) = e^{-x}$, which has a similarly decaying form when $x \\gt 0$. (As the Gaussian is symmetrical, limits $\\lt$ 0 can easily be calculated). The next step is to make a distribution function out of $p$ over the limits of the integration.
