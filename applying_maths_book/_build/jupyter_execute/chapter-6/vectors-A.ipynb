    "## Introduction\n",
    "Although vectors, such as force or velocity, have two 'dimensions' - magnitude and direction - mathematically, they can have any number of dimensions. A vector's components need not be objects in any physical space; this is not as bizarre as it sounds, for example, your car can be described by its make, colour, manufacture date, engine-capacity, and model. These values can form a vector such as (Ford, yellow, 2005, 1900 cc, estate). However, a vector is more than just a list; it is constructed from a basis set. The basis set contains the primitive components and the vector is constructed as a linear combination of these elements; more of this later. The basis set is not always apparent, for example, when drawing arrows on a graph, but in all cases, including topics as diverse as quantum mechanics and geometry, the basis set must be explicitly defined before a calculation is started. However, in apparent contradiction to this, many vector properties and formulae can be obtained by symbolically, which means algebraically, $\\boldsymbol{ A} + \\boldsymbol{B}$, etc., without a thought about the basis set, and some of these calculations are described in Section 6.2. As an aside, W. Hamilton, of Hamiltonian fame, first seems to have used the word 'vector'. J. Willard Gibbs who developed much of thermodynamics also largely developed vector analysis. \n",

    "## 1.1 Notation\n",
    "It is important to distinguish vectors from scalars. Scalars are printed in normal typeface, 1, 2, 3, etc. Symbols with an arrow $\\vec A, \\vec B$, and so forth will represent vectors. Square brackets $[1\\;3\\;-4]$ are used to represent a vector's components 1, 3, and -4, so a vector is written as $A= [1\\; 3\\; -4]$. If $A$ ends at a point on a graph,it is defined to have a basis set ( $x, y, z$ ) which, when it is necessary to be explicitly stated, will have round brackets as will coordinates of a point in space (4, 0, 2). Some authors put a line above a letter, e.g. $\\bar B$, to indicate a vector, we will place an arrow over the letters, for example vector $A$ to $B$ is written as $\\vec {AB}$. The vector's magnitude or length is enclosed in a pair of vertical lines as $| A|$; however, vertical lines are also used to indicate the absolute value of a quantity and represent a determinant, but the context should make the meaning clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Basis sets \n",
    "In describing many phenomena, such as the static magnetic field in an NMR machine, right-angled (rectilinear) or Cartesian axes are used. A vector can be represented in this space as a linear combination or multiples of three vectors of *unit length* each one pointing from the origin along each of the x-, y-, or z-axes. These three *unit vectors* form the basis set, and in three dimensions are normally labelled $\\vec {i}, \\vec{j}$, and $\\vec k $. In quantum mechanics, for instance, the basis set needed is not always that of spatial coordinates, and often comprises the set of quantum numbers a given atom or molecule possesses. The basis set for a car with the description, yellow Ford estate, 1900 cc, 2005 could be $\\text{(make, colour, manufacturing date, engine size, model)}$ making $\\begin{bmatrix}Ford & yellow& 2005& 1900 & estate\\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before basis sets are considered, some general vector properties are defined, which still apply whether we specifically use them in the form of the components of a basis set or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Position vectors \n",
    "Conventionally, positional vectors are drawn as arrows to indicate which way they point, and a set of axes is not usually shown. Some of the infinite number that could be drawn is shown in Fig. 6.1. Notice that in the top left of the figure, vectors $\\vec R$ and $\\vec S$ are the same even though they are displaced from one another because they have the same length and direction. Consequently, on the top right, $\\vec {R} \\ne \\vec{ S}$ because their directions differ even though their lengths are identical. The coordinate origin of each vector is always at its base, so $\\vec R$ and $\\vec S$ have their own local coordinate origin whether or not they are equal to one another. To add two vectors, form a triangle; to add three, form a rectangle; and form a polygon if there are more, so that the sum of all the vectors is zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Fig. 6.1 (iii), the vectors $\\vec {A},\\vec{ B}$, and $\\vec C$ are added by placing the head (or tip) of one to the tail of the other and completing the triangle, the equation is therefore \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec {A}+\\vec{B}+\\vec{C}=\\vec{0} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vec 0$ is the null or zero vector. It follows that $\\vec{A} + \\vec {B} = -\\vec {C }$ with $\\vec C$ as drawn in the figure with its head at the foot of $\\vec A$. The vector $-\\vec{C }$ has the same direction as $\\vec C$ but points in the opposite direction, i.e. its arrow-head would be at the head of $\\vec B$. Alternatively, the equation could be defined as $\\vec{A} + \\vec{B} = \\vec{C}$ where $\\vec C$ is the resultant of $\\vec{A} + \\vec{B}$. In this case, $\\vec C $would have been drawn so that it starts at the foot of $\\vec A$ and points to the head of $\\vec B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to get muddled with vector directions and the simplest thing is to make $\\vec {A} + \\vec{B} + \\vec{C} = \\vec{0}$ where the arrows are always head to tail, but note that in this case the resultant of adding $\\vec A$ and $\\vec B $ is $-\\vec C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To subtract the two vectors shown in (iii), to obtain $\\vec{ A} - \\vec{B}$, reverse $\\vec B$, which means placing the arrow tip on the other end of the line, see figure 1 (iv). Then place the tip of $\\vec A$ to the base of the reversed $\\vec B$; the result we shall call $\\vec D$. The subtraction $\\vec{B} - \\vec{A }$ produces the vector $-\\vec {D}$. \n",

    "In Fig. 2, OA and OB are vectors and because both start at the origin, they are called _position vectors_ . The basis set for OA and OB are unit vectors along the $x$- and $y$-axes only, because they are two dimensional. Vector OA comprises 3 units of the $x$-axis base vector and 2 units of the $y$-axis base vector. Later on, we will find that to solve some problems this basis set will have to be written explicitly as $(i, j)$ where $i$ and $j$ are the unit vectors along $x$ and $y$, but before doing this the properties of positional vectors are described and some problems solved.\n",

    "then $|\\vec V|= \\sqrt{9+16+25}=5\\sqrt{2}$ .In vector $\\vec{A}, a_1 =3,\\; a_2 =2$ or $\\vec {A} =[3\\; 2]$ and there is no $a_3$ because $\\vec A$ is two dimensional; its length is $13$ . \n",
    "\n",
    "The length or projection of $\\vec A$ along the x-axis is $\\vec A_x =|\\vec A|\\cos(\\theta)=3$ and along the $y$-axis $\\vec A_y =|\\vec A|\\sin(\\theta)= 2$ and the angle $\\theta =\\tan^{-1}(2/3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector $\\vec AB$ is defined as $\\vec {AB} = \\vec{B} -\\vec {A}$ (see figure 2) and the individual coordinates are subtracted, therefore $\\vec {AB} = (2, -5)$ and has length $| \\vec {AB}| = \\sqrt{29} = 5.385$. This vector is not the same as the dashed line in figure 2 between $A$ and $B$, but a parallel one starting at the origin and ending at $(2, -5)$. This illustrates that each vector has its own set of axes from which it springs; to make $\\vec AB$ start at the end of $\\vec A$ the origin of its axes have to be placed there, not at zero as our calculation did. The angle between two vectors, say $\\vec A$ and $\\vec {AB}$, can be calculated by trigonometry, but this is clearly awkward and is overcome by learning how to multiply two vectors together. This is described in the next few sections.\n",

    "## 1.4 Surface Tension\n",
    "The surface tension of a liquid is a property of the intermolecular forces that exist in a liquid. Mainly these forces are directed into the liquid at the surface with air (or with the liquid's vapour) and not out of the surface. The energy of molecules at the surface is greater than that of the bulk and consequently it takes energy to increase the surface area. In thermodynamic terms the surface tension $\\gamma$ is the rate of change of Gibbs energy with increase in area, $dG=\\gamma dA$ thus $\\gamma$ has units of force/length. The values of $\\gamma$ are in the range $20-30$ mN/m for common liquids such as acetone, benzene or ethanol, but are larger for water ($72.8$) because hydrogen bonds are broken and in liquid metals such as mercury where $\\gamma =485$ mN/m the surface tension values are large due to the coulomb attraction to be overcome by bringing an ion from the interior to the surface.\n",

The surface tension of n-decane is 23.9 mN/m and that between it and water is 52 mN/m which is not a huge amount less than that of water's surface tension because here also hydrogen bonds have to be broken to accommodate the hydrophobic liquid.\n",

    "## 1.5 Newton Diagrams, molecular beams and reactive scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "An important example of vector addition is found in Newton Diagrams which are used to describe the kinematics of  crossed molecular beams. In these experiments two gaseous species are cooled by expansion into a vacuum chamber and the atoms and molecules are made to collide into one another and the direction and energy of the scattered species is measured. Although the atoms or molecules are cooled they still have considerable velocity, a few hundred metres per second is not uncommon. If no reaction takes place the collision is called _elastic_ (Ar + Ne and Kr +HCl for example) and _inelastic_ if there is a chemical reaction such as $\\mathrm{K+CH_3I} \\to \\mathrm{KI +CH_3}$ or $\\mathrm{H+I_2}\\to \\mathrm{I+HI}$ and here the difference in velocity provides the kinetic energy to overcome any reaction barrier. \n",
    "\n",
    "A rough sketch of the experimental set up is shown in figure 2b. Inside the evacuated chamber, parts of which may be cooled with liquid nitrogen, the gas pressure is so low that there are no collisions between residual gas molecules and the molecular beams, and these only interact where they cross. After collision the species recoil in a manner determined by the potential energy between them, see Chapter 11.3.8 (Numerical Methods). By examining the number of particles detected vs. the measuring angle the shape of the potential energy between the interacting species can be elucidated. In some cases the recoiling species can be observed to be in the backwards direction, which means being scattered towards the source with an angle $\\Theta \\gt 90^\\text{o}$.  This is the case in the reaction $\\mathrm{K+CH_3I} \\to \\mathrm{KI +CH_3}$. The skimmer works to select only the centre part of the gas jet and so forms the molecular beam. Pumps remove excess gas before it enters the main chamber.\n",

Most of the gas/vapour is pumped away here but the centre part of the gas jet is passed into the reaction chamber via the skimmer. This is cone shaped with a very small hole in the apex. The main vacuum chamber is kept under ultra low vacuum. The detector can be moved in an arc to collect scattered species.\n",

    "The two beams are represented by vectors of length equal to their velocity. Often the beams approach one another at right angles as in figure 2b because this is simplest experimentally. The centre of mass is a constant of the motion and its vector is shown in the figure also. After collision, the centre of mass still moves along the same direction as before collision, but now the species move with different velocities i.e. different speeds and directions, see figure 2d.  In a Newton Diagram is conventional to show the reactant beams and scattered product beams on the same diagram but with the reactant vectors starting at zero together with the products. As there is spherical symmetry along the direction of each beam these angles are equivalent and so vectors can be drawn in a plane and for the purposes of illustration it is assumed scattering is in this plane also. The molecular beams will also have an energy and hence velocity spread, but, for simplicity we assume that this can be ignored.\n",

Additionally molecules have internal energy and this changes on reaction not least due to the differences in zero point energy but also other vibrational and rotational levels may be excited. This change in total kinetic energy means that the vector of the product must lie between two limits; no internal energy or $100$% internal energy and the (product) vector $\\vec w_1'$ can lie anywhere on a circle centred at the c.o.m. with radius $|\\vec w_1'|$. This also means that because $\\vec v_1'$ is linked to $\\vec w_1'$ it is to be found within a cone whose centre line is $\\vec v_{cm}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the impact parameter is large, at grazing incidence where their separation is a little larger than the sum of their radii, then a 'spectator stripping' reaction may occur. An example of this is $\\mathrm{K + I_2 \\to I + KI}$ where the I atom largely follows the trajectory of I$_2$ and is measured in the forwards direction. The other extreme case is rebound reaction in which there is backwards scattering, $\\mathrm{K+CH_3I} \\to \\mathrm{KI +CH_3}$ and $\\mathrm{H + Cl_2 \\to HCl + H}$ are examples of this and so the reaction must occur when the K or H atoms approach with small impact parameter, i.e. along the line of centres. \n",
    "\n",
    "A third possibility exists which is that the species form a complex instead of immediately scattering. If this complex is long-lived compared to the time it takes to reach the detector, a few milliseconds, then the only product to be observed will be in the direction determined by the centre of mass vector. If the complex is short lived, say a few rotational periods then the products will be sprayed out in all directions as it rotates making analysis very hard. See Bernstein (1982) and Steinfeld (1999) for a full explanation of reaction dynamics. "

    "## 2.5 Basis sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we define a basis set then specific, rather than general calculation can be performed. For example, if vectors $A$ and $B$ of figure 3 are given magnitudes we cannot tell what the angle between them is because we do not know how $A$ and $B$ relate to one another. A basis set provides the scaffold, as it were, on which the vectors are fixed. It is possible to choose different basis sets to solve the same problem and to convert between one set and another. The following three properties of vectors and basis sets are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Every vector is always made from a linear combination of the components of its basis set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Because a basis set is the minimal possible set, it cannot be decomposed any further or made any simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** Any vector is unchanged by changing its basis set and therefore its coefficients must change between bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the vector $A$ in figure 3 has components of $a$ units on the $x$-axis and $b$ on the $y$- and is therefore described as $\\vec A = a\\boldsymbol i + b\\boldsymbol j$. In Cartesian coordinates, the basis set most often used is made of orthogonal, unit vectors along each of the $x-, y-$ and $z$-axes; conventionally we represent this as the basis set $(\\boldsymbol i, \\boldsymbol j,\\boldsymbol k)$ where $\\boldsymbol i, \\boldsymbol j$ and $\\boldsymbol k$ are _orthogonal unit vectors_ . Figure 4 shows the basis set vectors and a three-dimensional vector separated into it basis set components. A unit vector has length of $1$, so a vector can be made from multiples of this. The $(\\boldsymbol i, \\boldsymbol j, \\boldsymbol k)$ basis set is described more detail in Section 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any vector can always be represented in several different but equivalent ways depending on which is easiest. We can choose to manipulate a three-dimensional vector in multiples of unit basis vectors $\\boldsymbol i, \\boldsymbol j, \\boldsymbol k$ or transform it into column or row matrices. The three-dimensional $\\boldsymbol i, \\boldsymbol j, \\boldsymbol k$ basis set written as three single column matrices and in standard form is\n",

    "\n",
    "The elements of basis set can be numbers, or they could be a vector, a matrix, or a function or a set of functions. Some examples are considered more fully after some basic properties have been described. Using functions as a basis set is described in Chapter 9. For the present, we shall assume that a suitable basis set always exists and perform some calculations.\n",

    "## 2.6 Vector origin\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is not otherwise specified, it is assumed that the origin of a vector is at the centre of the coordinates, i.e. at $(0, 0, 0)$. If this is not the case and the origin is at some other place, $(a, b, c)$ then we must subtract $a, b$, and $c$ from each of the three components and use $(x-a,\\;  y-b,\\; z-c)$  as our vector. This has the effect of moving the origin to the base of our vector. In addition, when subtracting two sets of coordinates to make a vector, its base is now at the origin of the new set of coordinates, i.e. the origin has again been shifted. This is important; a vector always starts at the origin of its own local coordinates, which may not be the same as initially drawn on a diagram, so some care is needed; vectors are only a direction and length in space; they carry around their own coordinate system or basis set with them but this is hardly ever drawn.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The magnitude of a vector $A$, which may be imagined as its length, is used as $|\\vec{A}|$. If $\\vec{A} = [a b c]$ where $A$ has components $a, b, c$ in the 3-dimensional basis set $(x, y, z)$, then\n",

    "To be clear: any vector such as $\\vec v$ is the linear combination of base vectors $\\boldsymbol i,\\boldsymbol j$, and $\\boldsymbol k$ taken in proportions $a, b$, and $c$. This is why the vectors $\\boldsymbol i,\\;\\boldsymbol j$, and $\\boldsymbol k$ are called the base vectors or the basis set for describing other vectors.\n",

    "At first sight, this seems a very complicated way of finding the dot product.

We can calculate a dot product fairly simply with the following rules:\n",

    "Calculate the dot product by multiplying both of the $\\boldsymbol i$ vector terms together, making $\\boldsymbol {i\\cdot i} = 1$, do the same for $\\boldsymbol j$ and $\\boldsymbol k$. Ignore, or make zero, all other cross terms, such as, $\\boldsymbol {i\\cdot j}$.\n",
