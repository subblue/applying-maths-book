    "## 18 Dihedral  angles\n",
    "The torsion or dihedral angle $\\vec \\psi$ between two bonds is something we might want to calculate from a chemical structure. A dihedral angle is the angle between two planes, see figure 41. Two such angles, $\\psi$ and $\\phi$ in proteins are used to generate Ramachandran plots as shown in figure 38. A regular or ideal protein helix would have angles $\\phi = -60^\\text{o}$ and $\\psi = -50^\\text{o}$ and real proteins with a large amount of $\\alpha$-helical character, such as bacteriorhodopsin, show clusters of points in this area. The other main feature of proteins is the $\\beta$-sheet and this is a more loosely defined structure and exhibits angles in the top left corner bounded by approximately $\\phi = -60^\\text{o}$ and $\\psi = +40^\\text{o}$. The exact areas describing the structure are limited by steric repulsion between the atoms as bonds rotate, and are described in most biochemistry, although few chemistry, textbooks. Ramachandran plots can be produced as part of the web interface of sites such as the RCSB Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb/) as well as in textbooks. You could also write your own program that can read '.pdb' or '.ent' files and produce a plot.\n",

    "Figure 38 Left: Ramachandran plot of the $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ torsion angles in the protein bacteriorhodopsin (pdb 1FBB), which contains extensive $\\alpha$-helices. Most angles cluster around the values $\\phi = -56^\\text{o}, \\psi = -53^\\text{o}$ typical of an $\\alpha$-helix. A regular or ideal helix would have angles $-60^\\text{o}$ and $-50^\\text{o}$. The area of $\\beta$-sheet structure, of which there is very little in this protein, is in the top left corner bounded by approximately $-55$ and $+60$ degrees. Right: The structure of the protein shows extensive helical structure. The retinal chromophore, which is positioned in the centre of the column of helices, is shown also.\n",

    "Part of a peptide chain is shown in figure 39. The backbone forms a repeating sequence -C$_\\alpha$-C-N-C$_\\alpha$-C-N-. The peptide unit is the CONH part of the structure, linked together by C$_\\alpha$ atoms containing the amino acid side-chain R. The C$_\\alpha$-C-O-(N-H) atoms lie in a plane, shown shaded in the top of the figure, as do the atoms O-C-(N-H)-C$_\\alpha$ shown shaded in the lower part. There are two main torsion angles, figure 39, which are $\\phi$, the torsion angle of the planes containing the CN-C$_\\alpha$C atoms which runs from the C=O to C=O groups, and $\\psi$, the angle between planes containing the NC$_\\alpha$-CN atoms which starts and ends on the nitrogen atoms. A third angle $\\omega$ is also defined as C$_\\alpha$C-NC$_\\alpha$ but in a regular protein, this is very close to $180^\\text{o}$. The peptide chain runs from the N terminal to the C. The N terminal of the protein occurs towards the end of the chain with the lowest indexed $\\alpha$-carbon, therefore the angle $\\phi$ is towards the N terminal, the $\\psi$ towards the C. Torsion angles for side-chains can also be defined; these are given the symbol $\\chi_1, \\chi_2$ etc. depending on the type of amino acid.\n",

    "The picture figure 40 shows that the N to N torsion angles $\\psi$ between planes containing N$_1$ and N$_2$, and N$_2$ and N$_3$, are both very small,$\\psi_1 \\approx -6,\\;\\psi_2 \\approx -14^\\text{o}$, which is the angle of the plane containing the bond N$_2$CA$_2$ to that containing the bond C$_2$N$_3$. In this notation, which is similar to that in the .pdb data, CA is the alpha carbon. The $\\phi_1$ angle $\\mathrm{C_1N_2-CA_2C_2}$ is approximately $-90^\\text{o}$; the $\\phi_2$ angle bond, $\\mathrm{C_2N_3-CA_3C_3}$, is $-140^\\text{o}$ approximately. The angles defined for proteins must range from $-180 \\to +180^\\text{o}$ and this means that the formula developed below has to have a condition applied to it and this is described at the end of this section. The calculation of the cosine of the dihedral (torsion) angle is developed next. \n",

One way to overcome this if $|angle| \\gt 90^\\text{o}$ it is subtracted from $180$ otherwise the absolute value of the angle is used, i.e. $\\text{180 - abs(angle) if abs(angle) > 90 else abs(angle)}$. This will force the dihedral angle to be in the range $0\\to 90^\\text{o}$.
