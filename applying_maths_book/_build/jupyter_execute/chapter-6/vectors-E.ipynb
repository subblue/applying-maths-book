    "### 16 Cross product or vector product\n",
    "The cross product of two vectors produces a vector rather than a scalar. This vector is at right angles to the other two; consequently, the cross product is unique to vectors in three- dimensional space. The symbol $\\times$ is used to indicate a cross product; some authors use $\\land $ although this less is common nowadays. \n",

    "If $\\vec u$ and $\\vec v$ are two vectors at an angle $\\theta$ to one another, the cross product is\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\vec n$ is a unit vector at right angles to $\\vec u$ and $\\vec v$, and shows that the result is a vector. It is not at all obvious why the cross product produces a vector; the product $|\\vec u||\\vec v|\\sin(\\theta)$ is a scalar quantity, i.e. a simple number possibly with units, but mathematically $\\vec u \\times \\vec v$ behaves like a vector perpendicular to the plane containing $\\vec u$ and $\\vec v$, and hence we multiply by $\\vec n$. It is easy to forget to do this. Because the cross product of a vector is perpendicular to either vector, the cross product of any vector with itself is always zero $\\vec u \\times \\vec u = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _magnitude_ or absolute value of the resultant vector is a scalar;\n",

    "and this is shown in figure 32 where the two resultant vectors point in opposite directions. Calculating the numerical value of a cross product can only be done by expanding the vectors in the basis set as components of unit vectors $i, j, k$, or a column or row vectors of the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships between combinations of dot and cross products can be calculated symbolically; for example, the expression $| \\vec A \\times \\vec B |^2 + | \\vec A\\cdot \\vec B |^2$  can be expanded using the definition of the cross and dot products.\n",

    "and _only_ applies when the plane is defined by its intercepts; notice that the intercept values only are used. This equation is particularly useful in crystallography to calculate the reciprocal lattice distance from the origin, and hence the inter-lattice spacing of crystals with orthorhombic (orthogonal) axes.\n",

    "### 16.6 Best plane through a set of points\n",
    "\n",
    "In haemoglobin, the porphyrin has four N atoms roughly, but not exactly, in a plane surrounding the Fe, and similarly in chlorophyll-containing proteins found in photosynthetic organisms, the four N atoms surround the Mg. We often need to know how far an atom is from the plane of another molecule. A plane is determined by choosing three atoms not four. However, four atoms defining the plane would be more useful and, in this case, a best-fit plane to these four atoms is needed. This plane can be calculated using a matrix method similar to that used to determine moments of inertia, and this is described in Chapter 7.13 or by least squares, chapter 13. When this plane is found, the equations developed in Sections 16 can be used to find distances.\n",

    "If $\\vec u, \\vec v$, and $\\vec w$ are vectors, the expression $\\vec w\\cdot (u \\times \\vec v)$ or equivalently $\\vec w\\cdot (u \\times \\vec v)$ or $\\vec w\\cdot u \\times \\vec v$ etc. is a _triple product_  Using the results from 16.1 this equates to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\qquad \\begin{align}\\vec w\\cdot u \\times \\vec v&=\\begin{bmatrix}w_x\\boldsymbol i+w_y\\boldsymbol j+w_z\\boldsymbol k\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}\\boldsymbol i&\\boldsymbol j&\\boldsymbol k\\\\u_x&u_y&u_z\\\\v_x&v_y&v_z \\end{bmatrix}\\\\&= (w_x\\boldsymbol i+w_y\\boldsymbol j+w_z\\boldsymbol k)\\cdot((u_yv_z - u_zv_y)\\boldsymbol i+(u_zv_x-u_xv_z)\\boldsymbol j+(u_zv_y - u_yv_z)\\boldsymbol k)\\\\&= \\begin{vmatrix}w_x & w_y & w_z\\\\ u_x  &u_y & u_z\\\\v_x & v_y & v_z\\\\ \\end{vmatrix}\\end{align}\\qquad \\text{(49)}$$\n",

    "This result shows that the triple product is a number, hence the prefix 'scalar', because it is the determinant of the coefficients of the vectors and a determinant is equivalent to a number not a vector. It must follow that it does not matter in what order vectors occur in this triple product because the result is a number; $\\vec w\\cdot \\vec u \\times \\vec v = \\vec u\\cdot \\vec v \\times \\vec w$ etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important application of this product is to calculate the volume of a solid body that has the shape of a parallelepiped; this is a prism whose faces are all parallelograms. If the body is _right angled_ and with vectors $\\vec a, \\vec b, \\vec c$ along its edges, then the determinant is diagonal and its value is $|abc|$, which is equal to the volume. In figure 36 the area of the base is $\\vec a\\times \\vec b$ and the volume this area multiplied by the projection of $\\vec c$ into $\\vec a\\times\\vec b$ which is $|\\vec c|\\cos(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the axes are not orthogonal, such as the $a, b, c$ unit cell vectors of crystals, then the dot products are neither one nor zero but have to be calculated as described in equation 34 for a monoclinic crystal. Note that the angle defined in the monoclinic crystal is different to that in figure 36a. In general, for a parallelepiped the volume = $| \\vec w\\cdot\\vec u \\times \\vec v|$ and the absolute value is used to ensure that this is positive.\n",

    "and the triple product denominator is the volume of the unit cell. From these relationships it is easy to see that $\\vec a \\cdot \\vec a^* = \\vec b \\cdot \\vec b^* = \\vec c \\cdot \\vec c^* = 1$. The vector $\\vec a^*$ is at right angles to the plane of $b$ and $c$ and similarly for the other reciprocal basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meaning of a reciprocal lattice can be seen if $\\vec a^*, \\vec b^*, \\vec c^*$ are calculated for an orthogonal unit cell. The simplest way is to define a basis set in three dimensions and if the unit cell lengths are $a = 5/2, b = 3/2, c = 2$ then the basis vectors are\n",

    "which is the difference between two vectors $\\vec B$ and $\\vec C$ scaled with a dot product, which is a number. The triple product is therefore a vector, as its name implies. This vector is perpendicular to $\\vec A$ and to $\\vec B \\times\\vec C$, which means that it lies in the plane of $\\vec B$ and $\\vec C$ and is a linear combination of these vectors.\n",

    "If the brackets are placed differently then a different vector is obtained $(\\vec A \\times \\vec B) \\times \\vec C = (\\vec A\\cdot\\vec C)\\vec B - (\\vec B\\cdot\\vec C)\\vec A$. There are other higher vector products, but you will only infrequently meet them. \n",

    "One use of the product is to make orthogonal axes. If $\\vec a \\equiv x$ then the cross product with any vector $\\vec b$ is perpendicular to this making $y\\equiv \\vec a \\times \\vec b$ and then $z$ is the cross product with this result, $\\vec a\\times (\\vec a\\times \\vec b)$"
