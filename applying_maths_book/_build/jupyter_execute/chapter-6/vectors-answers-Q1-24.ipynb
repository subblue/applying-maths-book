    "Suppose the forces are $f_1 \\cdot f_6$ then the resultant force is $ R= f_1 +f_2 +f_3 +f_4 +f_5 +f_6$.

The vectors are shown in figure 57. Vector $OA$ is $f_1$, and the addition carried out in a clockwise fashion starting with $O$A.

    "The plane travels along the vector $\\vec v_0$ when there is no wind with a ground speed $|\\vec V_0 | = 200$ mph (| | means use the absolute value). The $50$ mph wind from the west will push the plane towards the north and east if the pilot does not compensate for this. Consequently the pilot has to fly the plane with its nose pointing a little into the wind along the vector $\\vec V$, and therefore the wind vector is reversed and the resultant is $\\vec V = \\vec V_0 -\\vec W$, see figure 58.\n",

    "That $2\\theta =\\varphi$ can be shown quite easily using geometry, it is a little more difficult but not hard using vectors.  \n",

The triangle $AOC$ is equilateral thus $2\\theta+ \\angle AOC=180$ and also $\\varphi+\\angle AOC =180$ hence $\\varphi=2\\theta$. The angle $ABC$ is $90^\\text{o}$ as shown in a particular case by making $\\varphi = 90^\\text{o}$ then $\\theta = 45^\\text{o}$ and by symmetry so is $\\angle ABC$.

    "(b) When the vectors are parallel $\\cos(0)=1$ and then $\\vec A\\cdot\\vec B = |\\vec A ||\\vec B |$. Solving for $a$ produces an imaginary number, therefore the two vectors cannot be made parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result can also be appreciated without resorting to calculation. If two vectors are parallel then the ratio of their components must be in a constant ratio because one is displaced from other. The two vectors have components in the ratios, $a/b$ of $1/3 : 2/a : -1/11$, so no real value of $a$ will make the vectors parallel because the ratio will change with the value of $a$.\n",

By Pythagoras' theorem the length of the CH bond is calculated with distances as shown in figure 62, where $m$ is the middle of the base of the cube and the distance from the C atom to $m$ is $a$. The distance $mH$ is half the length of the diagonal of the cube and is $\\sqrt{2a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}$, therefore the length CH, the bond length, is $\\sqrt{a^2 + 2a^2} = a\\sqrt{3}$.
