    "In the Dirac notation, a ket is a column and a bra a row vector. The elements of the vector are those of the basis set used. Each ket always has a corresponding bra. The bra is formed as the _conjugate transpose_ of the ket, which means converting column into row and then taking the complex conjugate of each term. Formally the ket is the Hermitian adjoint of the bra, see Chapter 7.4.8. For example, if the ket is\n",

    "## 4.2 Discrete basis sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The bra and ket, equations 27 and 28 have terms $a,\\, b,\\, c$ and these are the elements of the basis set chosen for the calculation. All quantum problems using bra-ket notation must have a basis set defined before the calculation starts. Unlike many calculations using vectors, the basis set does not usually represent spatial coordinates but is instead some other relevant property. The spin state of the proton, which is described next, is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spin state of an atom or nucleus can be described with a spin quantum number $s$ and magnetic (azimuthal) quantum numbers $m$, which, when $s = 1/2$ has values $+1/2$ or $-1/2$, or, in general, $m = +s, +s - 1, \\cdots -s$ and thus is a range of values from $s \\to -s$ each separated from one another by unity. Sometimes the magnetic quantum number is labelled $m_s$ or $m_z$; the latter because it is the projection of angular momentum onto a unique axis normally labelled $z$ when a unidirectional magnetic field is present, Fig. 4.  The magnitude (expectation value of the angular momentum) is $\\hbar\\sqrt{ s(s+1)}$. Nuclear spin angular momentum is usually labelled with $I$ instead of $s$. If a magnetic field $B$ is along the $z$-axis, the energy of the spin depends on its orientation and is $E = -\\gamma m_z\\hbar B$ where $\\gamma$ is the magnetogyric ratio with units of rad T$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spin basis set for a spin half particle (electron, $^1$H, $^{13}$13C, etc.) can be constructed in terms of the two quantum numbers $s$ and $m$, labelled with two indices as $(s, m)$, and is\n",

In the case of spin half particles we conventionally reserve symbols $\\alpha$ to represent the state $(1/2, +1/2)$ and $\\beta$ to represent the state $(1/2, -1/2)$ and the basis set is now written as $(\\alpha\\,\\beta)$ or as kets $|\\alpha \\rangle$ and $|\\beta\\rangle$ as $(|\\alpha\\rangle \\;|\\beta\\rangle)$. Both notations are common. In this two-dimensional basis, the $\\alpha$ spin state $(s = 1/2, m = 1/2)$ is represented as the column vector in the standard basis set as $\\displaystyle |\\alpha\\rangle= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\alpha$ is a basis element (basis ket) of the standard basis set, it is zero everywhere except for one element representing its position in the basis set and which is given the value of unity. Similarly the $\\beta$ spin state $(s = 1/2, m = -1/2)$ is represented as as $\\displaystyle |\\beta\\rangle= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, and the basis set could be written as\n",
