# # 8. Matrices in Quantum Mechanics

# In the Huckel model of electronic energy levels, described in Chapter 7, the relative electronic energies of $\pi$ orbitals are calculated on the assumption that each $\pi$ orbital interacts only with it nearest neighbours. A matrix of interactions is constructed and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors found. In this chapter, problems that are more general are explored.
