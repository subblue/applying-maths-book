    "Solving the Schroedinger for the energy levels of a molecule, using a model such as a harmonic oscillator or rigid rotor, allows us to predict the spectrum. These spectral lines may, however, only be close to the experimental values not exactly matching them because of small unsuspected interactions. To investigate how to improve our model to better understand the data, changes to the potential energy are necessary. The harmonic oscillator, for example, has the Hamiltonian,\n",

We might try to improve on this, perhaps by adding cubic or quartic terms, such as $ax^3 + bx^4$, to describe the effect of the bond stretching. Similarly, we might consider adding terms in $J^4$ to the rigid rotor model to allow for centrifugal distortion during rotation. Alternatively, the harmonic potential model may be satisfactory, but the experiments report on the effects of small changes to the spectrum caused by external electric or magnetic fields. In this case, if the electric field $E$ is along the _x_-axis a term $E ex$ could be added to the Hamiltonian to allow for this. The use of perturbation theory allows for the incorporation of these and many other small potential energy terms to extend our knowledge a little into unfamiliar territory by using what is already known as a starting point.\n",

    "The main correction $a_k$ terms to the basic (unperturbed) wavefunction has the same parity as the unperturbed wavefunction. The correction to $n$ = 1 is mainly the $n$ = 2 wavefunction scaled by the constant $a_k$, and this is not so surprising, the adjacent wavefunctions (above or below in energy, if any) have the biggest correcting effect due to the inverse dependence of the energy gap; equation (43). In the case of $n$ = 4 then it is the third and fifth terms. It is also apparent that because of symmetry the $k = n\\pm 2$ correction terms are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second-order energy correction to the lowest level is given by equation (44), which has the relatively small value of $-3.664 \\cdot 10^{-22}$ J or $-18.44\\, \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$. The next and each term where $k$ is odd is zero. The term with $k$ = 4 is also negative and far smaller ($-0.02\\,\\mathrm{ cm^{-1}}$) than that with $k = 2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To check on the validity the calculation the condition of equation (46) can be checked using the values of the $a$ coefficients. The first level $n$ = 1 has 0.045 as its first and largest $a$ value, the second level, has $a$ = 0.029 and -0.045 as the largest two values so all of these satisfy the condition in equation (46) since the difference in energy levels $E_n-E_k$ is far greater than 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the particular case of a linear perturbation the integrals can be integrated algebraically, but as this is not the general case the code below performs the integrals numerically using numpy's 'quad' function."
