    "The grid search has the following form\n",
    "(1) Set initial values of rate constants and increments in $k_1, k_2$.\n",
    "(2) Outer loop 10 values. Inner loop 10 values.\n",
    "(i) Calculate equation, compare with data, print residual.\n",

    "(iv) Increment $k_2$.\n",

    "(3) Plot results\n",
    "The important part here is to match the data points ($15$ in total) with the 1500 used to integrate the equations. A simple way is to find the minimum between the times used to calculate the equations and the day ( $0 \\to 15$) and to make an array of the integr values. This is array indx in the code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this type of optimization is crude, it is simple to implement, and for a short calculation is not too time consuming. It is suitable in this instance, as both the calculated result and data are in numerical form and the derivatives with respect to the parameters $k_2$ and $k_1$ needed for more sophisticated search routines, such as Marquardt - Levenburg (Bevington 1969) are not available."

    "Comparing with an accurate result produced by python's internal algorithms, the simple Euler method fails even with $5000$ points in the integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is not therefore of rounding errors but that the approximation to each step of the integral is not good enough. Using the modified Euler method significantly improves the calculation but even this fails if $v$ is larger than $10$. Using a more sophisticated Runge - Kutta algorithm even that than given in the text improves the accuracy of the calculation.\n",

    "### Q20 answer \n",
    "Following the example in the text, the first thing is to estimate the parameters. Notice that $k_2$ and $S$ are always a product so that as $S_0$ is so large $k_2 $ will be very small. Then the algorithm of Q18 could be used, \n",

    "\n",
    "The data is very sensitive to the value of $k_d$, not surprisingly as only one term $k_dI$ determines its value. The best fit is found with $k_1 \\approx 0.0415, k_2\\approx 2.72\\cdot 10^{-7}$. The data is shown in fig. 38. The rightmost figure shows the daily trend in Covid19 deaths, which is the numerical derivative $\\Delta \\text{data}/\\Delta t)$ of the cumulative data. The fits are also shown on both plots.  They are quite good but not excellent. This is often the case with experimental data, and indicates that our model is rather simplified. One possibility is that the death rate is not correct and that this should also be varied. In this case a non-linear least squares method, such as described in Chapter 13 will have to be used.\n",
