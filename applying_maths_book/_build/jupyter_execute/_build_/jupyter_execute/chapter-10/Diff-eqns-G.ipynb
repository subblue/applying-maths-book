This initial condition is quite specific, and practical, but instead of keeping a constant value $c_0$ when $x \\ge 0$ and $t = 0$ the initial concentration can in general be a function of position, $f(x)$ which may range over the whole range of $x$.\n",

A second weaker laser stimulates the dye's fluorescence and the intensity of this is measured as the dye molecules diffuse into the bleached area.

At one end of the string, the condition is $u(0, t) = 0$; therefore, $u(0, t) = w(t)v(0) = 0$, which means that either $v(0)$ or $w(t)$ must be zero for all $t$. A wave that does not vary in time is not considered to be a standing wave, and this means that $v(0) = 0$ is a boundary condition.

The fundamental, or first harmonic, has $n = 1$; the second harmonic or first overtone $n = 2$, and so forth.

    "Fourier transforming a differential equation, such as the Schroedinger or diffusion equations often leads to a simpler equation in transformed space and one that can be solved easily. To get at the complete solution this equation has to be transformed back into 'real space' and even though this is now only involves an integral this can sometimes be tricky. If an analytic solution is not possible a numerical transform can be used.\n",

The integration is numerically difficult because $k^3$ becomes very large and the function is oscillatory about zero. The integral with $c=1$ is called an _Airy function of the first kind_ $Ai(x)$ and is usually included as a special function in most computer languages. This is the solution when $y\\to 0$ when $x\\to\\infty$, and there is a second Airy function solution to this equation in the limit that $y\\to\\infty$ (called $Bi(x)$) but we shall not be interested in this case."

Tunnelling is apparent into the non-classical region at large $x$ but not at $x=0$ because here the potential is infinitely high.

The time dependence of a wavefunction is obtained by multiplying by $e^{-iE_nt}$ for energy $E_n$ to make the wavefunction $\\psi_{x,n,t}=\\psi_{x,n}e^{-iE_nt}$. The probability of being at  position $x$ is the product $\\psi^*_{x,n}\\psi_{x,n}$ where * indicates the complex conjugate and so all time disappears.

This is shown in figure 30b for the sum of wavefunctions $n=5,m=6$ and for fractions of the period, $0,0.2,\\dots$ as shown in each panel. The reinforcing and destructive interference are clear. With lower quantum numbers the extension is smaller and the period longer because the energy gaps are greater.

    "Excited molecules decay away via non-radiative processes and fluorescence but if lateral or rotational diffusion or energy/exciton transfer also destroys the fringes, this provides a way of measuring this property via the decrease in diffraction intensity of a probe laser. Similarly thermal gratings can be produced and probed. The weak probe laser can be at the same or a different wavelength to the pump and is aligned to be diffracted into a different spatial position to the pump so is easily identified. The technique varies a little depending upon what is measured but usually short pulse lasers are used, picosecond or femtosecond and in this case it is clearly essential that the arrive in the sample at the same time. As an example, if polarised light is used those molecules whose transition dipole is aligned with the polarisation of the pump (with a $\\cos(\\theta)$ probability ) are preferentially excited. Subsequent rotational diffusion of the excited molecules can be measured because as the molecules rotate the polarised grating is diminished as the initially aligned transition moments are randomised and therefore the probe pulse has fewer molecule aligned with its polarisation to interact with. By measuring at different delay times, wrt the pump laser,  the probe pulse can map out the rotational diffusion in a pump-and-probe manner.\n",
