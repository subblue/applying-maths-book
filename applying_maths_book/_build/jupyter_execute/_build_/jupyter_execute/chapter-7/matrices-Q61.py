# ### Q61 Moments of inertia of HCN
# 
# (a) Calculate the moment of inertia of the linear molecule HCN, using masses $m_N, m_H$ and $m_C$ for the most common isotopes of the atoms and bond lengths $r_{CH}$ and $r_{CN}$ given in the text. Explain why isotopic substitution is necessary to obtain the bond lengths. The parameters needed are defined in Figure 70.
# 
# (b) Calculate the numerical value of the com displacement Î´, Fig. 7.70, then the moment of inertia I using the values of the bond length given in the text for the isotope containing 1H, 14N and 12C atoms.
# 
# (c) Assuming rigid-rotor behaviour, calculate by how much a rotational transition will shift if $^{14}$N and then $^{13}$C isotopes are used.
# 
# **Strategy:** On the diagram of the molecule choose a point to represent the centre of mass (com) and find its $x$ coordinate. Write down the equation for the moment of inertia based on this point, and the equation for the centre of mass and assume that this is at $x = 0$.
