    "### 6 Projections\n",
    "To find the projection or component of a vector $\\vec A$ that lies along an axis, the dot product with one of the vector's orthonormal base vectors is calculated. For example, to calculate the component along the x-axis the base vector $\\boldsymbol i$ is used;\n",

    "This shows that only the $x$ component is extracted and you can see how to obtain the $b$ and $c$ components using $\\boldsymbol j$ and $\\boldsymbol k$ instead of $\\boldsymbol i$. More usefully, since the dot product can be written as\n",

    "is the _projection_ of the component of vector $A$ along the $x$-axis, which is the same result as obtained by trigonometry. Recall that $|\\vec A |$ is the magnitude of $\\vec A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _projection_ of a vector $\\vec w$ onto another $\\vec v$, produces a new vector $\\vec P$, which is calculated in a similar way to the projection onto a base vector. The diagram figure 17 shows two vectors and their projection, $\\vec P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection of $\\vec w$ onto $\\vec v$ is made in three steps: the length of the projection is the size of the vector $\\vec w$ multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them, as in figure 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the vectors are greater than three dimensional then the $(\\boldsymbol i, \\boldsymbol j, \\boldsymbol k)$ basis cannot be used and matrices are used instead. For example if $\\vec w=\\begin{bmatrix}1& 3& 5& 7\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\vec v = \\begin{bmatrix}2& 4& 6& 8\\end{bmatrix} $ the projection of $\\vec w$ onto $\\vec v$ is still given by eqn 14.  \n",

    "#### **(ii) Distance on a sphere**\n",
    "Calculating the distance from one point to another on the surface of a sphere is easily achieved using vectors. Figure 17a shows two points $P$ ans $Q$ are a distance $d$ apart on the great circle which is the shortest path on the surface. The spherical polar angles are $\\theta$ the polar angles and $\\phi$ the azimuthal angle. If the distance $d$ was on the Earth then a slightly different notation would be used because the latitude is the angle upwards from the equator in other words $90-\\theta$. The longitude is the angle from the $x$ axis, (the azimuthal angle) and on earth the prime meridian is at zero longitude and passes through Greenwich in London. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the calculation simpler the points $P,Q$ can be rotated as a pair so that $P$ lies on the x-axis, the angle $\\phi$ is then the difference in longitude to point $Q$. The second simplification is to define the radius of the sphere as unity. The distance can always be multiplied by the radius at the end of the calculation. In figure 17a (right) if the radius is $1$ as drawn then $d$ the arc length is numerically equal to $\\omega$, i.e. $d=\\omega$ because  $\\omega/2\\pi = d/2\\pi R$ on a sphere of radius $R$. The chord length $c$ is clearly not the same as the arc length $d$. The dot product,\n",

The points are $P=[x_1,y_1,z_1], Q=[x_2,y_2,z_2]$ in Cartesian coordinates but we only know them in spherical polar ones. The conversion is found using projections onto the $x,y,z$ axes.\n",

The $z$ value $z_2=\\cos(\\theta_2)$ but to find the $y$ and $x$ values the length of the projection of $Q$ in the xy plane is needed and this can be seen as point $a$ and is $\\sin(\\theta_2)$. Next the projections of $a$ onto the x and y axes are needed, thus $y_2=\\sin(\\theta_2)\\sin(\\psi)$ and $x_2=\\sin(\\theta_2)\\cos(\\psi)$. The $Q$ vector is therefore\n",

    "\n",
    "If we were calculating the distance between two locations on Earth then an equivalent formula is used. First as latitude is defined as the angle towards the north pole from the equation or $\\chi=\\pi/2-\\theta$ cosine and sine in $\\theta$ are swapped, and secondly the latitude is usually written as the difference in longitude or $\\Delta \\lambda$ instead of $\\phi$ and with these changes $\\psi \\to\\Delta \\lambda$ and replacing the angle with $d/R$ produces\n",

    "While this equation is exact, it had difficulties in the past when computer precision was limited and still does if the numerical precision of the calculator is limited, i.e. not 64 bit or double precision. This is because for small distances $\\Delta \\lambda\\to 0$ and its cosine becomes very, very close to 1 and the equation returns a distance of zero because also $\\chi_1 \\approx \\chi_2$. In geographical terms this means a distance of $\\approx 3$ km or less will produce an inaccurate, i.e wrong value.  This can be appreciated when $\\Delta \\lambda$ is small because then $\\cos(\\Delta \\lambda)\\to 1$. This changes \n",

    "\n",
    "To correct for this numerical inaccuracy two approaches are made. First use the identity $2\\sin^2(x/2)=(1-\\cos(x))$ to convert the cosine to sine and secondly simplify with $\\cos(x_2-x_1)=\\cos(x_2)\\cos(x_1)+\\sin(x_2)\\sin(x_1)$ and after some manipulation produces the Haversine formula historically used for accurate determination of distances.\n",
