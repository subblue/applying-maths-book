    "## 3.1 Clever substitution can help to solve an integral\n",
    "\n",
    "It may appear at first that if an integral is not in a standard form then it cannot be solved - not so! The purpose of substitution is to convert the integral into a standard and therefore simpler form whose solution is known. Choosing a substitution is rather an art and some trial and error is usually required. However, just as in football, a clever substitution can produce the required result.\n",

    "\n",
    "The usage of $du$ and $dx$ as independent entities in themselves in step (2) appears to be different to that of $du/dx$, which has previously been used as a ratio.

    "## 5.5 Evaluating integrals *via* differentiation and  'Feynman's trick'\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the derivative of an integral is found we naturally want to evaluate the integral itself. This can be achieved only by knowing the value of the integral $F(x)$ at, for example, $F(1)$ or $F(0)$ etc. because this allows the integration constant to be calculated. The 'Feynman's trick', as integration using derivatives has become known, uses an artificially added parameter with which to differentiate with the purpose of removing some terms in the integral and thereby simplifying it. Finally, this parameter is set to a value as appropriate to re-form the initial integral. Some examples should make this method clearer, but it has to be remembered that a lot of cunning and imagination is often required to make this method work.\n",
