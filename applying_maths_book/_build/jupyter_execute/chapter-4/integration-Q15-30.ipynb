Finally calculate what happens when $\\beta = 0$, thus making the exponential term unity and so returning the original integral. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other limit is infinity because this makes $I_\\beta = 0$. You will find that the initial differentiation removes the denominator, making the integral simpler. It is an integral met before and one that can be performed by parts; see Section 5.\n",

    "## Q30 Soap films\n",
    "The equation describing the shape of the soap film described in Q 82 may be derived by considering the surface tension $T$ of the film. Every point on a vertical circle around the film has an equal horizontal surface tension, which is equal to a constant $c$. Therefore, $2\\pi yT \\cos(\\theta) = c$. By calculating the cosine for small changes of $x$ and $y$ in the limit of $dy$ and $dx$, find an equation for $dy/dx$. Separate this into integrals in $y$ and $x$ and integrate both sides to find the equation for $y$, the film,s radius. Finally convert the equation into a hyperbolic trig form.\n",
