To plot the parametric equations, $t$ is varied and points at { $x,\\, y$ } plotted. How large $t$ has to be to complete the curve depends on how $t$ and $x$ and $y$ are related and has to be tested before plotting. \n",

Since the variable is $t$, not only is it necessary to convert $dx$ into $dt$ using $(dx/dt)dt$, but also to convert the integral's limits $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. If these are _not_ defined in terms of $t$ but as $x_\\alpha$ and $x_\\beta$, it is a little more complicated and it is necessary to define $x_\\alpha = f_x(\\alpha)$ and $x_\\beta = f_x(\\beta)$ where $f_x$ is the $x$ parametric function and both these equations will have to be solved to find $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n",

    "Sometimes equations are simpler and calculations easier when not done in Cartesian (rectilinear) coordinates but in polar or one of several other coordinate systems. Using Cartesian coordinates to integrate closed curves, such as circles or cardioids and so forth, can also lead to some pitfalls. The equation of a circle of radius 1 and centred at the origin $(0, 0)$ is $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. When integrated, because exactly half the area is above the x-axis, this part should have a positive area and the half below a negative one making the total zero, whereas the area is clearly $\\pi$. Rearranging to find $y$ and integrating gives $\\int_{-1}^{1}\\sqrt{1-x^2}dx=\\pi/2$ and although the integration was across the diameter $x = -1$ to $1$, only half of the area has been evaluated. This is because, by convention, only the positive part of the square root was used, and although it appears that we have integrated over the whole area in fact only half of the area has been covered. If $-\\int_{-1}^{1}\\sqrt{1-x^2}dx$ is added to account for the other half, the result is zero. The area of the cardioid shown in Fig. 11 would similarly be zero because there is as much negative area below the x-axis as there is positive above it. A common way round this problem of false zero areas is to identify a symmetrical curve, calculate part of it and multiply the result according to symmetry, to obtain the whole area.\n",

The pole is at $r = 0$ and the horizontal $\\theta = 0$. A circle of radius $a$ centred at the origin is $x^2 + y^2 = a^2$ in Cartesian coordinates but $r = a$ in plane polar coordinates. \n",
