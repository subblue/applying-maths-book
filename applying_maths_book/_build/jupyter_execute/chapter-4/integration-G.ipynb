    "## 12.1 Molecular orbitals\n",
    "Molecular orbitals (MO) are orbitals that extend over the whole molecule as opposed to being located on or between particular atoms. In $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$, one of the simplest molecules, the MOs are formed by bringing the two lowest energy atomic orbitals (wavefunctions), $\\varphi_{sA}$ and $\\varphi_{sB}$ together. In the situation that the MO is $\\varphi_{sA}+\\varphi_{sB}$, the atomic orbitals are in phase and a bond is formed; constructive interference has occurred between the two wavefunctions. The other simple combination, $\\varphi_{sA}-\\varphi_{sB}$, leads to destructive interference and little electron density between the nuclei. Such a combination is known as an anti-bonding MO. The amplitude of the two MOs are shown in Figure 29.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry of the $\\mathrm{H_2^+}$ molecular ion is defined as a function of the separation $R$ of the protons, $N_1$ and $N_2$, and of the electron $M$ with each proton, Figure 30. One possible separation of the electron from the two protons is shown but the electron can occupy any position in space. The interaction between the electron and the proton is electrostatic and attractive while that between the two protons is repulsive. The electron has kinetic energy as do the nuclei, but to make the calculation easy we assume that the nuclei do not vibrate but have fixed positions on the z-axis and so have no kinetic energy. This approach is called the Born -Oppenheimer approximation and is a good approximation when nuclear motion is far slower than that of electrons. This is due to the difference in their masses; the ratio of mass is at least $m_p /m_e = 1836$.\n",

In this calculation, the electrons are allowed to move to find their minimum energy at any inter-nuclear separation $R$. This is then changed and the energy recalculated. This makes the energy a function of nuclear position $R$, but not the electron's position $r$, and thereby the potential energy curve is obtained.

    "### **The chemical bond forms due to a lowering of the electronic potential energy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the separation between the protons is reduced from a large value, the energy of their mutual (electrostatic) repulsion increases. The fact that the total energy of H$_2^+$ passes through a minimum as a bond forms means that the electronic energy decreases faster than the repulsion $q^2/R$ increases but at very short distances $R\\to 0$ the nuclear repulsion dominates. At any bond length, the total energy $E$ has to be the sum of the electron's kinetic and potential energies, $E=\\langle T\\rangle + \\langle V\\rangle$, hence the question is: does the lowering of the electronic energy arise from a reduction in the electronic potential energy or a lowering of the kinetic energy or from both?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, the Virial Theorem can be used. This is a theorem from the study of mechanics and is extremely powerful as it can be applied to any (bounded, conservative) mechanical system (Goldstein 1980, Hamill 2014) such as a planet orbiting its sun. The theorem is statistical in nature because it calculates the average kinetic energy $\\langle T\\rangle$ (over time) and shows that this is proportional to the average potential energy $\\langle V\\rangle$, i.e. $\\langle T\\rangle \\propto \\langle V\\rangle$. In the case that the potential is a power law $V(r)\\propto r^{n+1}$ the relationship becomes \n",

    "In the H$_2^+$ molecule the kinetic and potential energy can be determined rigorously. To do this the variation of the total energy $E$, with respect to the positions of the nuclei must be known. In the special case of a diatomic molecule the kinetic energy of the electron $\\langle T_e\\rangle$ and the potential energy $\\langle V\\rangle$ are given by (C. Cohen-Tannoudji, B. Du, F.

    "Using results already calculated, Figure 32 shows that both the kinetic and potential energy have a minimum in the region of the bond but that the decrease in kinetic energy is very small compared to that in the potential energy. The minimum in total energy when the bond is formed is at $\\rho \\approx 2.5$, see dotted line in Figure 32, and is $E_+$, see Figure 31. The decrease in potential energy when the two nuclei come together therefore dominates the stabilization of the chemical bond because the kinetic energy is rising slightly at the bond minimum but the potential energy is falling rapidly. If the kinetic and potential contributions to the energy of the anti-bonding orbital $E_-$ are calculated, the potential energy still shows a small minimum but this is dominated by a large positive kinetic energy contribution, leading to no overall minimum in the energy.\n",
