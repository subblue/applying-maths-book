    "## 1 Basic concepts\n",
    "Broadly speaking, integration is used to calculate the amount of some quantity. This might be the total concentration of a chemical product produced up to a certain time, the total amount of work done by a gas when expanding or that done in moving an object against gravity. Consider, for example, calculating the amount of oxygen in a tall column of still air. This is not simply the volume of the column times the gas density because gravity increases the O$_2$ concentration close to ground level. To calculate the total amount of O$_2$, the change in density has to be allowed for by integrating from the ground upwards, which means knowing how the density varies with altitude. Bearing in mind that integration will give us the total amount of O$_2$, the obvious way would be to take the column and divide it into many thin horizontal slabs, work out the amount of O$_2$ in each, and add them all up. The integral is the result that would be obtained when the slabs are made infinitesimally thin and, as with differentiation, the change is from a finite amount to an infinitesimal one, $\\Delta x \\to dx$. When this change is made the summation becomes an integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a general curve described by some function $f(x)$, and further suppose that it can be integrated because not all functions can be. Imagine splitting the area under a graph of $f(x)$ into $n$ small rectangles over the range $x = a$ to $x = b$ some of which are shown in the sketch, Figure 1, where there are only four rectangles. The purpose of doing this is to find the total area under the curve as accurately as possible. The total area of all the rectangles is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle  A_{approx} = f(s_1)\\Delta x_1 + f(s_2)\\Delta x_2 + f(s_3)\\Delta x_3 + f(s_4)\\Delta x_4 =\\sum_{i=1}^n f(s_1)\\Delta x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the value of the function at position $s_1$ is $f(s_1)$ and so forth. You can see that the rectangles only very approximately follow the curve since only four are used and a poor approximation to the area under the curve is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the accuracy of the calculation, it is obvious that the rectangles have to be made narrower and more of them have to be used. When $\\Delta x_i$ is made infinitesimally small, in the limit $\\Delta x \\to 0$ and $n \\to \\infty$, the summation $A_{approx}$, still over the range $a$ to $b$, becomes the _definite_ integral\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle A=\\int_a^b f(x)dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is, without approximation, exactly the area under the curve of $f(x)$ from an $x$ value of $a$ to that at $b$. The integration range $a \\to b$ is often called the closed interval $a$ to $b$ and the definite integral is sometimes called the Riemann integral. The area under the curve $f(x)$ is calculated even though the function depends only on $x$, and this is because $f(x)dx$ is dimensionally the height $f(x)$ times the width $dx$. In a general sense, integration increases the dimension of the calculation: a point to a line, a line to an area, an area to volume and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the curve falls entirely below the x-axis and integration will produce a negative result. Mathematically, there is nothing wrong with a negative area but sometimes this may present a problem in imagining the integration as an area belonging to something physical; however, work and energy can be positive or negative, so the context is all important in interpreting what the integration means. A result should be checked against intuition, by asking the question: 'am I expecting a positive or a negative result?' You might also want to ask 'is the result going to be large or small?'.\n",

    "\n",
    "The integration operation be written either as $\\int f(x)dx$ or $\\int dx f(x)$. The latter is often used in physics texts particularly when $f(x)$ is a long and complex expression. In this case the integration is always assumed to extend over the function immediately following $dx$. As an aside, the symbol $\\int$ was first introduced by Leibniz (1646 - 1716) is the stylized $S$ from the Latin word _summa_, reminding us that integration and summation are intimately linked. Leibniz named the integral calculus, calculus _summatorius_. An integral is also sometimes called an anti-derivative.\n",

    "This result is an _indefinite integral_ and a constant is always added to the answer because the starting and ending values of $x$ were not defined. You can see from figure 2 that the result of integration is going to be different depending on where the integration starts and ends. The constant effectively allows this to be determined later. Recall that differentiating a constant produces zero, and therefore differentiating $(g(x) + constant)$ reproduces $f(x)$ no matter what value the constant has, i.e. the constant is arbitrary, therefore\n",

    "An example met early on in studying thermodynamics is to calculate the work $w$ done on an ideal gas, as its volume changes.

Doing this is not strictly correct but as the constant is arbitrary until some values are added, the equation is better rewritten as \n",

The constant of proportionality being is the rate constant $k$. If the sign is negative, this indicates that $c$ is being lost and is forming another species that is not specified in the rate equation such as A $\\to B$ This differential equation is solved by separating out the two variables $c$ and $t$ and integrating each side separately:\n",

    "\n",
    "Integration is often a trial and error process, and some experimenting with different options is necessary even when using the computer. Start by simplifying expressions, perhaps by using partial fractions, then look for standard formulas and standard methods such as integration by parts. If none are found suitable, substitutions can be tried, then standard forms and methods looked for again because only with these can an integration be found. If all else fails, numerical methods have to be used; see Chapter 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration formulae for various functions can be derived in a similar way to that for differentiation by taking small values of $dx$ and $dy$ and then calculating $x + dx$ and $y + dy$. The method is now well established and most results are given below without derivation. Understanding the physical world is hard enough work without having to prove all of mathematics before we can use it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Several integrations are listed in Section 13, and Sympy can be used to do even more complex integrations. Why then, you might ask, should you bother to learn how to do integration? Calculations are done 'by hand' not only because it is often easier and quicker to do so, but also because it encourages a greater understanding of how the result was obtained. Additionally computer methods do not always work, and if you have an answer how will you know that it is correct if you have no understanding of the processes involved.\n",

    "## 2.10 Improper and undefined integrals\n",

    "A number of functions when integrated produce infinity. These are conventionally called improper integrals, although there is nothing 'improper' about them, e.g. $\\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^x}{x}dx=\\infty$.  The integrand $f(x)$ usually has a point in the range of integration at which it becomes infinite. This can often be spotted, and surprisingly, only sometimes does this produce an infinite result. As an example, in the integral $\\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}dx$  the reciprocal of the square root becomes infinite at $x = 0$. Ignoring this for the moment, integrating using equation 6 then working out the limits produces a finite answer, \n",

    "Conversely the integrals of the form  $\\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^2}dx$ or $\\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{x-1}dx$ and many similar reciprocal functions produce infinity and so are undefined or improper. Infinity is a strange beast.  Not surprisingly, if the range of the integration is changed so that the integrand is not infinite in the range, the integrals behave normally and give a finite result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.11 Integrals with infinite limits\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the limit of an integral may extend to infinity, some integrals are nonetheless finite. One example of this was given in the previous section. Naturally, some may also become infinite: $\\int_0^\\infty xdx$ is clearly going to be infinite as its result $x^2$ will become infinite when $x$ is infinity. It is probably true that most polynomial functions in which its largest power is positive will reach $\\pm \\infty$ with limits 0 to infinity. If a function is odd, such as $xe^{-x^2}$ and the limits extend equally far to the left and right even to infinity, then the integral is always zero, as discussed in Section 1.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "With reciprocal functions, or polynomials with negative powers, as the limit extends to infinity the function becomes smaller and smaller and so may converge to a finite value. For instance, integrating $1/x^2$ from 1 to infinity produces a finite result:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^2}=-\\frac{1}{x}\\bigg|_1^\\infty = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating $1/x$ over the same range produces infinity and you can appreciate this if you look at a graph of the log function because this increases for all $x \\gt 1$.\n",

    "## 2.12 Discontinuities\n",

    "Very occasionally a function has a discontinuity such as a vertical step. If this is at point $b$ and the integration is from $a \\to c$ with $b$ in between, the integral is split into two parts, one part from $a \\to b$ the other from $b \\to c$; see Section 1.3.\n",
