    "The kinetic energy is zero and the total energy $E$ is the same as the potential energy at the turning point, figure 38.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) By definition the energy is $E=\\int k(r-r_e)dr$ and because $k$ and $r_e$ are constants, these can be taken outside the integral\n",

    "(b) Using values for $k$ and $r_e$ this energy is $0.89 \\cdot 10^{-19}$ J / molecule or $53.6\\,\\mathrm{ kJ \\, mole^{-1}}$, which is $\\approx 12$% of the dissociation energy - a surprisingly large amount.\n",

    "## Q2 answer\n",
    "(a) Taking logs of both sides of the Arrhenius equation produces $\\displaystyle \\ln(k) = \\ln(k_0) - \\frac{E_a}{RT}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating with respect to $T$ gives $\\displaystyle \\frac{d\\ln(k)}{dT}=\\frac{E_a}{RT^2}$ as in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) To integrate this differential equation, separate the equation into parts in $k$ and in $T$ as \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "and integrate both sides separately. Because the term $d\\ln(k)$ integrates to $\\ln(k)$ the result is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\ln(k_2)-\\ln(k_1)=-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\bigg|_{T_1}^{T_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be simplified to $\\displaystyle \\ln\\left( \\frac{k_2}{k_1} \\right) = \\frac{E_a}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_1}-\\frac{1}{T_2} \\right)$ which can be further rearranged into the equation in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3 answer\n",
    "Rearranging to separate variables produces $\\displaystyle \\int\\frac{dc}{c}=-k\\int dt$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating both  sides separately gives $\\ln(c)=-kt+q$ where $q$ is a constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The constant must be included and is undefined until the problem is specified exactly. Because the concentration is $c_0$ at $t = 0$ the calculation can be continued in two ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "First taking the result $\\ln(c) = -kt + q$, when $t = 0,\\, c = c_0$ then $q = \\ln(c_0)$ and therefore $\\ln(c) = -kt + \\ln(c_0)$ or \n",

    "\n",
    "which produces the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4 answer\n",
    "(a) Rearranging the equation and adding limits gives $\\displaystyle \\int_{v_0}^v\\frac{dv}{v}=-\\frac{3\\pi\\delta\\eta}{m}\\int_0^t dt$ \n",

    "\n",
    "The exponential must be dimensionless therefore the ratio, $\\displaystyle \\tau = \\frac{m}{3\\pi\\delta\\eta}$ represents a time. To prove that this is a time, add dimensions to the constants. Viscosity is usually measured in centipoise which is not an SI unit. The SI units of viscosity are $\\mathrm{ kg\\, m^{-1} \\,s^{-1}}$ and $1 cP = 0.001\\,\\mathrm{ kg\\, m^{-1}\\, s^{-1} }$.

    "\n",
    "(b) Estimating the time means knowing the mass and size of the particles. Benzene and similar molecules may be estimated to be $\\approx 0.3$ nm in diameter, and of mass $\\approx 100$ amu where $1\\, \\mathrm{amu} = 1.66 \\cdot 10^{-27}$ kg. The viscosity of water is 1 cP. The relaxation time for benzene is therefore approximately\n",

    "\n",
    "or 60 fs, and this must be about the time between intermolecular collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation for the protein is just as straightforward, except that the mass of the protein is not known. One way round this is to use a typical density $\\rho$ and $100 \\,\\mathrm{kg\\, m^{-3}}$ is typical, the mass is $\n",
    "\\rho\\delta^3$. The time is therefore \n",

    "$$\\displaystyle \\tau =\\frac{\\rho\\delta^3  }{3\\pi\\eta}\\approx 10^{-12}\\text{s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which means that the direction of the initial movement is lost within about a picosecond, which is a very short time considering the relatively large size of a protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5 answer\n",
    "(a) In this case,the answer can be guessed to be something like $\\ln(3x - 2)$ because of the reciprocal in $x$ in the function. Differentiating this guess gives $3/(3x-2) $ and therefore $\\displaystyle \\int\\frac{dx}{3x-2}=\\frac{1}{3}\\ln(3x-2)$.\n",

    "(b) Converting to exponentials gives \n",

    "With some manipulation this can be returned to a trig form which is $x/2 + \\sinh(2x)/4$.\n",

    "(c) This can be converted to exponentials first giving $I=\\cosh^2(x)/2$\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Expanding the integral gives $\\displaystyle I=\\int 2\\ln(2x)-\\ln(1-x)dx$ which has a standard form, see 2.13.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) The function in the integral is odd so the integral is zero because the limits are symmetrical about zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) The integral becomes a standard one the type $x^{n+1}/(n+1)$ by letting $u-x-3$. Thus this is an example of using substitution to simplify and then solve the integral. \n",

    "$$\\displaystyle \\int_0^L \\frac{1}{4}\\left( 2-e^{2iLx}-e^{-2iLx} \\right)dx = \\frac{L}{2} -\\frac{\\sin(2L^2)}{4L} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sine cannot be greater than $\\pm 1$ so that when $L$ is large, for example $\\gt 100$, this term becomes small because it is divided by $L$ and the limit approaches $L/2$.\n",

    "## Q8 answer\n",
    "Because of the term in $1/V$ this is a logarithmic integration; \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\int_{V_1}^{kV_1} pdV=\\int_{V_1}^{kV_1}\\frac{nRT}{V}dV=nRT\\ln(V)\\bigg|_{V_1}^{kV_1}=nRT\\ln(k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and in the last step $\\ln(kV_1)-\\ln(V_1)=\\ln(kV_1/V_1)$ was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q9 answer\n",
    "(a) If $V$ is the initial volume which is reduced to 10%, then the work done is calculated using equation 6 ($\\displaystyle \\int x^n dx$) with power $n=-\\gamma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle w=\\int_V^{V/10}pdV=-\\int_V^{V/10}\\frac{k}{V^\\gamma}dV=-\\frac{kV^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}\\bigg|_V^{V/10}=\\frac{kV^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}(1-10^{\\gamma-1})$$\n",

    "Substituting values in $pV^\\gamma = k$ makes $k = 101325 \\times 5.0^{1.404}\n",
    "= 9.707 \\cdot 10^5$ J and therefore $w = +1.96 \\cdot 10^6$ J.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) The first law states that the work done on the gas plus the heat transferred to the gas must be equal to the change in internal energy of the gas, $dU$ where $dU = \\bar dq + \\bar dw$. As no heat enters or leaves, the change in heat $\\bar dq = 0$, and the work done is the same as the change in internal energy. This depends only on the temperature and at constant volume $dU = C_V dT$ therefore, for $n$ moles of gas, the work done is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w=n\\int_{T_1}^{T_2}C_V dT =\\frac{5nR}{2}\\int_{T_1}^{T_2}dT=\\frac{5nR}{2}(T_2-300)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the volume and pressure are known, $n = 203.12$ moles and solving for $T_2$ produces $T_2 = 756$ K which is the temperature of the gas immediately after compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar notation $\\bar dq$ and $\\bar dw$ means that in the language of thermodynamics when integrated, they form _path integrals_, i.e. normal integrals to you or me, and their value depends on the way the heat changes or the work is done. Some authors instead use $\\delta q$ and $\\delta w$ to indicate a path integral. The internal energy $U$ is a state function and when integrated, its value depends only on the starting and ending values not on how the internal energy was obtained by the molecules for example $\\displaystyle \\int_{U_1}^{U_2} dU=U_2-U_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q10 answer\n",
    "(a) If $V_0$ is the initial, $V_1$ the final volume then the work done is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle w=-\\int_{V_0}^{V_1}pdV\\quad\\text{ where }\\quad \\displaystyle p=\\frac{nRT}{V-nb}-\\frac{an^2}{V^2}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle w=-\\int_{V_0}^{V_1} \\frac{nRT}{V-nb}-\\frac{an^2}{V} dV=-nRT\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1-nb}{V_0-nb}  \\right) +an^2\\left( \\frac{1}{V_0}-\\frac{1}{V_1} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) The units of the second term need some care; they are \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle a \\,(\\mathrm{ bar \\,dm^6 \\,mol^{-2})\\,n\\,(\\,mol^2)/V(\\,dm^3)  = bar\\, dm^3} = 100 \\text{ J}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since pressure is force/area and $1 \\mathrm{ bar = 10^5}$ Pa, multiplying by $1 \\times \\mathrm{ m^3}$ would convert this into $10^5$ joules; (energy = force $\\times$ distance) but the volume is in dm$^3$ or $10^{-3} \\mathrm{m^3}$ so the conversion is 100. Substituting the constants gives the work as 18.3 kJ. The ideal gas by comparison needs more work at 22.4 kJ to compress it.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) If the gas were O$_2$ then the van der Waals equation suggests that $21.9$ kJ are needed and if H$_2$ then $23.6$ kJ.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy need to compress the Cl$_2$ is less than that for ideal gas, that for O$_2$ about the same, and H$_2$ slightly greater. The difference is due to the interplay of the attractive potential term $a$ and the repulsive one $b$. If the attractive forces dominate as the gas is compressed the molecules will remain closer to one another for longer than if they were hard spheres. This reduces the effective pressure and so less work is needed. This is the case for the polarizable chlorine molecules. If repulsion dominates,then the molecules avoid one another effectively increasing the pressure and this is the case for H$_2$, which is weakly polarizable, compared to Cl$_2$. The energy to compress is larger. Oxygen molecules seem to have a balance of repulsion and attraction that makes them appear to behave as it they were ideal, but this is an accidental cancelling of two effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q11 answer\n",
    "(a) The enthalpy change is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle H_T^\\mathrm{o}-H_{298}^\\mathrm{o}=\\int_{298}^T a+bT+\\frac{c}{T^2}dT=a(T-298)+\\frac{b}{2}\\left(T^2-298^2\\right)-c\\left(\\frac{1}{T}-\\frac{1}{298}  \\right)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "(b) Using the values for the constants produce $H_T^\\mathrm{o} - H_{298}^\\mathrm{o} = 2.95$ kJ/mol and $S_T^\\mathrm{o} - S_{298}^\\mathrm{o} = 9.14$ J/mol/K.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{dp}{dT}=\\frac{\\Delta S}{\\Delta V}$$ \n",

    "Notice the form of the phase diagram. At low temperatures $\\approx 260$ K and pressures $\\approx 1000$ Pa, only benzene vapour exists. As the pressure is increased, a vertical movement in the diagram, the vapour condenses to the solid phase. Not until the temperature reaches $\\approx 280$ K is there enough energy for the vapour to form the liquid phase when the pressure is increased. Below this temperature, the solid sublimes. Notice also how vertical the phase transition line between solid and liquid is. In many textbooks, it is misrepresented as a somewhat sloping line. The solid-liquid boundary will still appear as an almost vertical line if the graph is plotted with the log of the pressure up to $10^6$ Pa.\n",
