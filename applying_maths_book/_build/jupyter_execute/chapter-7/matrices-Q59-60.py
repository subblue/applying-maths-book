# ## Q59 XeF$_4$ moments of inertia.
# Calculate the moments of inertia of the planar molecule XeF$_4$ 
# 
# (a) about the C$_4$ symmetry axis and 
# 
# (b) about a diagonal and also about an edge. 
# 
# Assume each bond length is $2 \unicode{x212B}$ .

# ## Q60 Loop of wire
# A circular loop of wire is formed by n rigidly connected masses with radius $R$ of total mass $M$. Explain the different values obtained for the moment of inertia,
# 
# (a) About an axis z, through the centre of the loop, 
# 
# (b) about a diameter,
# 
# (c)  About an edge and parallel to $z$.
# 
# The difference in moments of inertia, is illustrated in Figure 68, and in the right-hand diagram where the loop rotates about an edge.
# 
# **Strategy:** For a planar body to simplify the calculation, use the perpendicular axes theorem $I_z = I_x + I_y$ and by symmetry $I_x = I_y$.
