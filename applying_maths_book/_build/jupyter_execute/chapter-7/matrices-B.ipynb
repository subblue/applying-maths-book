    "## 4 Basic properties of Matrices\n",
    "The rest of this chapter describes the properties and uses of matrices. The determinant described in the previous sections can be considered as one of the many properties of a matrix. In several places, reference is made to eigenvalues and eigenvectors before they have been fully explained, which is done in Section 12.3. The meaning of these words is outlined below but how they are obtained is left unanswered for the moment.\n",
    "The eigenvalue - eigenvector equation is met, for example, in solving problems in Quantum Mechanics and Chemical Kinetics and has the form,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle  \\mathrm{operator \\times function = constant \\times same\\; function}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "provided the function is not zero. In matrix form, the eigenvector - eigenvalue equation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{Ax}=\\lambda \\pmb{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\pmb A$ is an $n \\times n$ square matrix, $\\pmb x$ is one of possibly $n$, one-dimensional column matrices (column vectors) each of length $n$ and each one is called an *eigenvector*, $\\lambda$  represents one of $n$ numbers, and each $\\lambda$ is called an *eigenvalue*. What this equation shows us is that the operator (matrix $\\pmb A$) changes a vector $\\pmb x$ by stretching or contracting it by an amount $\\lambda$ but leaves it pointing in the same direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(i) Addition and subtraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "To add or subtract two matrices they must have the same shape. To add or subtract a constant or another matrix their individual elements are added or subtracted. Similarly, to multiply or divide by a constant number (a scalar), each element is also multiplied or divided by this value. Multiplying two matrices together is more complicated and depends on the order with which this is done and the shapes of the two matrices; sometimes it is just not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation used, is that bold italic letters indicate a matrix and the numbers $\\pmb 0$ and $\\pmb 1$ for the null and unit matrix respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose two matrices are $\\displaystyle \\pmb{A}=\\begin{bmatrix} 2&1&5\\\\-5 & 2 & 6\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\displaystyle \\pmb{B}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1&10&8\\\\-3 & 3 & 9\\end{bmatrix}$ calculating \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{A}+\\pmb{B},\\; \\pmb{A}-\\pmb{B},\\;\\pmb{3A}+\\pmb{0.5B}\\quad\\text{etc.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is easy, for example, taking elements individually,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{A}+\\pmb{B}=\\begin{bmatrix} 3&11&13\\\\-8 & 5 & 16\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and similarly for the other calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(ii) Division**\n",
    "One matrix _cannot_ be divided by another; the inverse matrix of the divisor is formed instead and then these matrices are multiplied together. The inverse of a matrix $\\pmb M$ is always written as $\\pmb{M}^{-1}$. Generating the inverse of a matrix is difficult unless the matrix is small, and one would normally use Python/Sympy to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(iii) Multiplication**\n",
    "Matrices can be multiplied together. The multiplication order is always important; $\\pmb{AB}$ is not necessarily the same as $\\pmb{BA}$. With three or more matrices $\\pmb{ABC}$, the multiplication sequence does not matter as long as the ordering is the same. This is the associatite property\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{ABC}\\equiv \\pmb{A}(\\pmb{BC})\\equiv (\\pmb{AB})\\pmb{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\pmb{BC}$ are multiplied first, then the result left multiplied by $\\pmb{A}$, this is the same as multiplying $\\pmb{AB}$ to form a new matrix, $\\pmb{D}$ for example, then performing the multiplication $\\pmb{DC}$. Habitually, we start at the right and multiply the $\\pmb{BC}$ pair first then left multiply by $\\pmb{A}$. The details are described in Section 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few special matrices and several types operations that can be performed on matrices and these are describe next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 The zero or null matrix\n",
    "As you would expect it is possible to have a matrix of zeros; adding this to another matrix changes nothing, but multiplying by it annihilates the other matrix leaving only the zero matrix as you would expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{0}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & \\cdots \\\\0 & 0 \\cdots \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\pmb{A}+\\pmb{0} =\\pmb{A};\\; \\pmb{A0}=\\pmb{0};\\; \\pmb{0A}=\\pmb{0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 The unit or identity matrix  $\\pmb{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a matrix of unit diagonals with all other elements being zero. The unit matrix is also called the _multiplicative identity_.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{1}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0& \\cdots \\\\0 & 1 & 0 &\\cdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ \\vdots  & & &\\ddots\\end{bmatrix}\\qquad \\pmb{A1}=\\pmb{A};\\; \\pmb{1A}=\\pmb{A}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 Diagonal matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a matrix whose diagonals can take any value, but all other elements are zero. The unit matrix is a special case. In general\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\begin{bmatrix} a & 0 & 0& \\cdots \\\\0 & b & 0 &\\cdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & c & 0\\\\ \\vdots  & & &\\ddots\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.4 Trace or character of a matrix\n",
    "The trace, spur, or character of any matrix $\\pmb M$, is the sum of its diagonal elements only, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle Tr(\\pmb{M})=\\sum_{i=0}a_{i,i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for example \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pmb{M}= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 3 & -1 & 0  \\\\ 0 & 4 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad Tr(\\pmb{M})= -1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By multiplying out the product of matrices, the trace of the product is found to be unchanged if they are permuted cyclically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Tr(\\pmb{ABC}) = Tr(\\pmb{CAB}) = Tr(\\pmb{BCA})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This fact is very useful in group theory because the trace of a matrix forms a _representation_ of a molecule's symmetry. Because of this rule, the trace, and hence representation, is independent of the basis set used to describe the symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.5 Matrix transpose $\\pmb{M}^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "The transpose operation replaces rows and columns with one another, and so  exchanges element $(1, 2)$ with $(2, 1)$, and $(1, 3)$ with $(3, 1)$ and so on. For example;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f   \\end{bmatrix}^T= \\begin{bmatrix} a & d \\\\b & e\\\\ c & f \\end{bmatrix}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and for a square matrix this operation leaves the diagonal unchanged, and is, in effect, a reflection about the diagonal,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\g & h & i  \\end{bmatrix}^{\\,T}= \\begin{bmatrix} a & d & g\\\\b & e & h\\\\ c & f & i\\end{bmatrix}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "You can appreciate that two transposes reproduce the initial matrix $(\\pmb{M}^T)^T = \\pmb{M}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _symmetric_ matrix is equal to its transpose and therefore must also be square and have off-diagonal elements $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. An _antisymmetric_ matrix satisfies the identity $\\pmb{A} = -\\pmb{A}^T$ and must therefore have zeros on its diagonal and have components $a_{ij} = -a_{ji}$; for example, such a matrix and its transpose is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 3 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 4 \\\\-3 & -4 & 0  \\end{bmatrix}^{\\,T}= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 & 3\\\\2 & 0 & -4\\\\ 3 & 4 & 0\\end{bmatrix}=-\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 3 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 4 \\\\-3 & -4 & 0  \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",

    "## 5.6 Block diagonal matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "In many instances, a matrix can be blocked into smaller ones symmetrically disposed along the diagonal. The result of this is that the problem reduces to the lesser one of solving several matrices where each is much smaller than the whole and is therefore more easily solved. Why should we bother with this if the computer can diagonalize any matrix we give it to do? The reason is that eigenvalues can more easily be identified within the basis set by doing the calculation this way. Recall that the basis set you choose to use, for example in a quantum problem, determines the ordering of elements in a matrix. Why does this matter? It matters because when the spectrum from a molecule is observed, which measures only the difference in energy levels, we would like to know what quantum numbers give rise to what spectral lines. If the matrix is a block diagonal one, then this is made somewhat easier because we know what parts of the basis set elements are involved because each block when diagonalized contains only that part of the basis set that was in it in the first place. If the whole matrix is diagonalized blind, as it were, and without thinking about the problem beforehand, this information can be lost because all the elements and hence eigenvalues can be mixed up. The elements in the basis set can be ordered in any way you want, and different basis sets can be chosen for the same problem. By trying different ordering, it is sometimes possible to discover a block diagonal form for a matrix and so aid its solution. In the study of group theory, blocking matrices proves to be a powerful way of determining the irreducible representation; see Section 6. \n",
