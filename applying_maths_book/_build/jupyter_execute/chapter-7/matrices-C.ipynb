    "When we learn to draw molecules and molecular orbitals their inherent symmetry becomes clear; benzene or perhaps tetrahedral methane spring to mind and possibly the geometry of sp$^2$ and sp$^3$ hybridizations. To characterize exactly what such symmetry means is the role of molecular group theory. This can also be used to determine the selection rules of spectroscopic transitions, to characterize the 'shapes' of normal mode vibrations and simplify molecular orbital calculations. In chemistry, the word 'symmetry', while retaining its colloquial meaning also has a technical meaning and this might appear to be rather abstract and divorced from other topics such as quantum mechanics and spectroscopy. Group theory's jargon does not help in learning the subject mainly because it appears to be so abstract. In fact, it is quite the opposite: it is intensely practical, and expresses a complicated set of rules and ideas in a few symbols; $D_{6h}$, for example, encapsulates all the many symmetry properties of benzene. The jargon we shall have to understand will lead us to be able to distinguish between \n",

    "The organization of this section is as follows: first, the geometrical properties of symmetry elements and operators are introduced. These are then used to identify a point group. It is then shown how two combined operations lead to the formation of an operator multiplication table, and how a symmetry operation can be represented by a matrix. Next, the pertinent properties of a mathematical group are described, and it is demonstrated how symmetry operations can form such a group. The character table is described next, and it is shown how the symmetry operations can be represented by a row of numbers rather than as a matrix or a symmetry label. Understanding how to use the information presented in the point group to characterize molecular vibrations and orbitals is our ending point.\n",

    "## 6.2 Essential jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetry is defined as the relationship between parts of an object or between groups of objects in space. To identify the _symmetry elements_ inherent in a molecule, we look at those geometrical operations that can be performed that will make the molecule _indistinguishable_ from its initial state. Rotations and reflections are two of five such operations and are described further in Section 6.3. Group theory shows how symmetry properties can be represented by a set of numbers, called _characters_ when collected into a table called a _point group_ or *character table*, see Fig. 15 for an example. It is quite remarkable that in the context of group theory, a symmetry operation such as rotating a molecule can be represented by a number, often $0$ or $\\pm 1$ although other values, including complex numbers, are possible depending on the point group. These numbers are the _characters_ of the point group and a _row of characters_ is called an _irreducible representation_ or 'irrep'. The character table uniquely defines the symmetry of a molecule and properties, for example, how different molecular orbitals behave and whether visible, infrared, and Raman transitions can occur, and, if they do, the orientation of the transition dipoles in the molecule. All the symmetry operations belonging to each point group are listed along the top row of a point group table; see Fig. 7.15. The characters are in the body of the table. In the next paragraphs, these concepts are expanded upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most molecules contain very little symmetry, cholesterol or SOCl$_2$ are examples, but water, ammonia, chlorobenzene, ferrocene, and particularly benzene each have many symmetry elements. The more 'regular' the molecular structure is, the larger the number of symmetry elements it contains, which increases the number of symmetry operations that can be performed on these elements. To work out what point group a molecule belongs to and to determine its properties, the victim molecule is subjected to a given set of symmetry operations about each of the symmetry elements that may be present. You look at the molecule and then decide, by intuition, experience, or trial and error, which symmetry elements are present. The point group is then identified by the set of operations that leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its starting condition. The starting point is thus to know what the symmetry elements and operations are, and then to learn how to determine which ones are present in a molecule. Usually a simple three-dimensional model will help when doing this; it is sometimes difficult to 'see' the symmetries present from a sketch even if it is in perspective. It is a skill that improves with practice, and, as with riding a bicycle, if it is not done for a while, you can be a bit 'wobbly' to begin with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 Symmetry operations and Symmetry Elements\n",
    "Symmetry operations act _via_ those symmetry elements that the molecule contains, which may be an axis, mirror plane or centre of inversion. The operation moves the molecule in space to a new, perhaps indistinguishable position, but the symmetry elements remain fixed. The words 'operation' and 'element' are often used interchangeably, but technically the operation can only occur about a symmetry element. For example, with a water molecule which has the same symmetry as ClO$_2$, Fig. 11, you will usually see a mirror plane (the element) and the reflection (the operation) at the same time. The operations and elements are linked because certain operations can only act on certain elements. If an operation does not leave the molecule indistinguishable, then it is not present.\n",

    "The effect of any valid symmetry operation is always to leave the molecule in an _indistinguishable_ state$^*$ not necessarily an _identical_ state. To understand this important distinction further, consider the square shown in Fig. 8, where the label is used only to identify one corner. Rotating the square by $90^\\text{o}$ (in 'math speak' operating with a $+\\pi/2$ rotation operator) makes the right-hand square indistinguishable from the left-hand one. Only after four similar rotation operations are the two squares *identical*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study of group theory shows that there are only five types of operators that could leave a molecule in an indistinguishable state. However, before operating on a molecule, a principal axis must first be chosen. All the symmetry operations are referenced with respect to the _principal axis_, which is the axis of highest rotational symmetry in the molecule. If two or more axes are the same, then one victim must be chosen. Figure 9 shows some examples. It is normal also to choose the principal axis as the z-axis and then to define x- and y-axes at right angles in the usual way. If the molecule is planar, as is naphthalene, the z-axis is usually chosen to project out of the plane.\n",

Rotation by $180^\\text{o}$ is labelled $C_2$, by $120^\\text{o}\\; C_3$, etc. The subscript defines how many times the operation that makes the molecule identical has to occur. A molecule may have rotation about more than one axis. The label $C$ is a shorthand for cyclic.\n",

    "### **(iii) Reflection**\n",
    "Reflection in a mirror plane$^{**}\\; \\sigma$ The symmetry element is a plane. There are three types of mirror planes: vertical if the mirror edge runs along the principal axis, horizontal if this axis is at $90^\\text{o}$ to the mirror, and dihedral if the mirror divides two axes; see figure 10. There may be more than one of each type of mirror plane in a molecule. For example, water or ClO$_2$ has two vertical planes labelled $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma'$ or $\\sigma_V$ and $\\sigma_V'$ (or $\\sigma(y,z)$ and $\\sigma(x,z)$), see Figure 11. A horizontal mirror plane is labelled $\\sigma_h$, a dihedral plane $\\sigma_d$. One or more superscript dashes ' are added if more than one of a type of mirror plane is present. In cases where a mirror plane falls on two axes this may alter- natively be labelled $\\sigma(x, z)$ etc.\n",

    "### **(v) Rotation - reflection**\n",
    "A combined rotation - reflection operation, $S_n$, also called an _improper rotation_. There may be more than one of these. The axis subscript $n$ is defined as in (ii). The operation is rotation followed by reflection in a plane perpendicular to the rotation, $\\sigma_nC_n$. Figure 14 shows an example of an $S_4$ operation ($S$ is from the word *Sphenoidisch*).\n",

    "Three examples of rotation operations are shown in figure 9. The ammonia molecule when rotated about the principal axis by $120^\\text{o}$ becomes indistinguishable. It is also indistinguishable if rotated by twice this amount, but if rotated three times it is more than indistinguishable; it is identical to the starting state of the molecule. The molecule is also indistinguishable if rotated by $-120^\\text{o}$ or $-240^\\text{o}$. The label $C_3$ represents one rotation operation as the molecule is moved by $120^\\text{o} = 360^\\text{o}/3$ of a turn; two rotations are labelled $C_3^2$ and three $C_3 \\equiv E$. If you are unclear about this, label the H atoms 1, 2, 3 and draw out the pictures or make a model; it really does help to do this yourself. The water molecule has only to be rotated by $\\pm 180^\\text{o}$ to become indistinguishable, which is a $C_2$ operation. The fluorinated acetylene can have any angle of rotation to become indistinguishable and this is labelled $C_\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider symmetry or mirror planes. There are three types, as shown in figure 10, defined relative to the principal and other axes. The molecule SOCl$_2$, figure 11, has one chlorine atom that is in front of the plane and one that is behind it and the SO atoms are in the plane. This molecule has only one vertical mirror plane and no other symmetry operations are valid, other than the identity. Only the mirror plane makes the molecule indistinguishable. The symmetry operations for chloride dioxide, which has a $C_{2V}$ point group label, as do water, SO$_2$, and pyridine among many others, are also shown in figure 11, except the identity, which is always present but changes nothing. The first step is to define the principal axis and as ClO$_2$ is bent into a V shape, the axis has the direction shown in the figure. (The molecule could be also drawn the other way up.) There are only four types of operations in the $C_{2V}$ point group, which are (i) the identity $E$, (all molecules have this); (ii) rotation by $180^\\text{o}$ around the principal axis labelled $C_2$; and (iii) there are two vertical mirror planes $\\sigma_V$ and $\\sigma_V'$ . The superscript dash is only used only to distinguish one axis from the other. If a set of $x, y, z$-axes are drawn on the molecule with $z$ as the principal axis, then the mirror planes could alternatively be labelled $\\sigma(xz)$ and $\\sigma(yz)$. There is a possible ambiguity because some authors place the x-axis in the plane of the molecule and some place the y-axis here. You need to check this when looking at different point group tables. The mirror planes are vertical because their edge runs along the principal axis. If the axis passed perpendicularly through the middle of a mirror plane, this would be a horizontal mirror plane, figure 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize: in the $C_{2V}$ point group, the only symmetry operations present are the identity, whose symbol is $E$, and is present whatever the point group, one rotation $C_2$, and two mirror planes, $\\sigma_V$ and $\\sigma_V'$. A $C_3$ or $C_4$ rotation, which would be rotation by $120$ or $90^\\text{o}$  respectively, cannot make the molecule indistinguishable from its starting position and neither can an inversion or any type of improper rotation operation $S_n$, and thus they are not present.\n",

You could choose another orientation of axes if you wanted to, but however the axes are chosen the molecule still has three $C_2$ axes, three mirror planes running along these axes, a centre of inversion and a mirror plane in the plane of the molecule, labelled $\\sigma_h$ because it is perpendicular to the principal axis. The other element is the identity $E$. With this information the point group can be identified. The next section shows how this may be done.\n",

    "The web site www.molecule-viewer.com has $\\approx 500$ examples of molecules in all commonly used point groups. The 3D images are rotatable and planes and axes can be added as hints to test your ability to identify the point group.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to assign a point group, first see if the molecule is a 'special case', that is tetrahedral, octahedral, icosahedral (football shaped), or is 'cylindrical/linear' such as O$_2$, HCl or FCCF, FCCH, etc. and identify it on this basis alone; see Section 6.5 for examples. You can always check later to see if you have guessed correctly by comparing with the point group (character) table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, look for any obvious overall rotational symmetry; for example, benzene clearly has sixfold symmetry and pyridine twofold, and this often indicates the principal axis direction and the symmetry label for the highest rotation operator. If a centre of inversion is present, this severely limits the choices of point groups. Particular axes or mirror planes can now be hunted down. Usually these will be enough to restrict your search to one or two point groups. At this point, you will have a list of some rotations and mirror planes and perhaps an inversion. The next step could be to look at tables of point groups and to see how best to match them with your findings so far. The table you choose may suggest the presence of some feature that you have missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the highest (principal) axis is twofold symmetric, the point group will be restricted to those with a $2$ in their subscript, $C_{2V}, D_{2h}$, etc. The groups with $C_2, C_3$, etc. labels are single axis groups, meaning that _only one rotation axis_ is present. Molecules with more than one rotation axis are labelled $D$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three groups have low symmetry and are $C_1$, fully asymmetric, $C_s$, e.g. SOCl$_2$, with only one mirror plane, and $C_i$, which only has  a centre of inversion. At the other end of the scale, the cubic groups, tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral molecules, have very many symmetry elements and are easily identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better than guessing is to use a systematic way of finding the point group and a 'route map' algorithm is shown in figure 17. The route map follows roughly the same method as just outlined. Sometimes a shortcut can be made by using the point group labels because they contain a shorthand version of the symmetry operations. The $C$ and $D$ groups are very common and the meaning of the labels is shown in figure 16. Assigning point groups is a strange skill; you can become very proficient quite quickly, but lose this skill equally quickly if it is not practiced. However, with a little revision, this soon returns.\n",

    "Figure 19 shows one $C_2$ rotation; two of them will make the molecule identical or $C_2C_2 = C_2 = E$ and similarly using figure 11 shows that reflecting in either of the mirror planes twice each in succession, also produces an identical molecule; therefore, $\\sigma^2 = E$ and $\\sigma '^{2} = E$. Multiplying an operator by itself produces the diagonal terms in figure 18. The identity multiplied by itself is still the identity; similarly, the identity multiplied by any other operator leaves the operator unchanged so this produces the left-hand column and top row. What remains are the other off-diagonal terms, such as $\\sigma_VC_2$ and $C_2\\sigma_V$ and these are left for you to confirm. The result for this point group is a symmetrical product table meaning, that in the $C_{2V}$ point group all the operators commute with one another, which is called an _Abelian_ group. This is not always true; for example, see the $C_{3V}$ table produced in Q 17. Being able to form a new species by multiplying two others is very useful when determining, say, the effect of a reflection in, for example, $C_3$  or $C_5$  where angles are not $90^\\text{o}$ and when one reflection and a rotation is already worked out. \n",

This would follow the rules for forming a group but would be useless, as one operation could not be distinguished from another.

    "\n",
    "**(a)**$\\quad$ There must be an identity operator that commutes with all others in the group and leaves them unchanged. The identity is always labelled $E$.\n",
    "\n",

    "The members of the $C_{2V}$ group are $E, C_2, \\sigma_V, \\sigma_V'$. The multiplication table, figure 18, shows that rule (ii) is followed, because each of the entries in the table is a member of the group. In symmetry operations on molecules, it is common for the inverse and the operator to be identical, i.e. an operator can be its own inverse; for example, $C_2C_2 = C_2 = E$ meaning that $C_2^{-1} = C_2$. This shows that rule (iv) is followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.8 Symmetry Operations as matrices\n",
    "Although we can perform symmetry operations in a geometrical sense, as was done to produce the $C_{2V}$ product table, these can be rather awkward to use. It turns out that a symmetry operation can be performed as a matrix multiplication using as a basis either a molecule's atoms, or its orbitals or bonds. The _trace_ of the matrix, the sum of its diagonal terms, will form a _representation of each operation_ and so form a representation of the group. The matrix used for each symmetry operation used must be a unitary matrix, $| \\pmb{M} | = 1$, because bond angles and lengths must be unchanged to maintain a molecule's symmetry.

The way linear, $x, y, z$ and product e.g. $xz, z^2\\cdots$ and rotational operators $R_{x,y,z}$ transform are shown in the right-hand most columns. The entries in the body of the table are called the *characters*, and hence the name *character table*. The symbols (Mulliken labels,$A_1,E_{2g}$ etc.) in the left-hand column are the labels of the *irreducible representations* but usually these are called the symmetry species. The ordering is such that the totally symmetric representation is always the top row and lower symmetry below this. (There are rules for determining the order but these need never bother us). The *classes* are the columns in the table, often there are two operations with identical characters and these are preceded by a number, e.g. $2C_3$ in the $C_{3V}$ point group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all point groups, the top row has one of the symbols $A, A', A_1, A_{1g}'$ or $A_{1g}$ depending on the point group but $\\Sigma_g$ for $C_{\\infty V}$  and $\\Sigma_g^+$ for $D_{\\infty h}$ and is  always the totally symmetric representation; the lowest row is the 'least symmetric'. The symmetry species $B_2$ in the $C_{2V}$ point group has the properties that it is unchanged by the identity $E$; is changed by $180^\\text{o}$ rotation about the $C_2$ axis and by reflection in the mirror plane $\\sigma$, but unchanged by reflection in mirror plane $\\sigma'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram, figure 15, shows the various properties contained within the point group table, in this case for $C_{3V}$. The Mulliken label '$E$' in the bottom left-hand column in the table means that this irreducible representation is doubly degenerate. This should not be confused with $E$ the identity operation.\n"

    "Molecules of the $C_{3V}$ point group allow a more general description of how the characters in the table are obtained. Molecules such as $\\mathrm{NH_3, NF_3,SOCl_3,CHCl_3, CClH_3 }$ belong to this point group. When a molecule has a three-fold or higher rotation axis this introduces some degeneracy, for example in CHCl$_3$ molecules, rotation about the x-axis or about the y-axis (see fig 21a) will lead to identical energy levels because the moment of inertial about these two axis is the same. Figure 21a shows the effect of rotation and reflection on a molecule belonging to the $C_{3V}$ point group. $x_1,y_1$ represent a unit vector situated on the C atom and along the $x,y$ axes and $x_2,y_2$ the transformed vector after the operations shown.\n",

    "To workout what symmetry species each orbital corresponds to, or in general any basis set function,  we have to operate on each orbital in turn and then use a projection operator.

    "The $C_{4V}$ point group has operations $E, 2C_4, C_2, 2\\sigma_v,2\\sigma_d$. Using the equations derived above the effect a $C_4$ rotation on each d-orbital can be listed. Similarly for reflections, but as the class is $2$ for reflections and $C_4$ these must be split into two, e.g. $C_4$ and $C_4^3$ for example. A $5 \\times 8$ table is then formed in which each orbital is subjected to each symmetry operation In each operation the orbital is changed into $\\pm$ into itself or $\\pm$ one of the other orbitals because angles are multiples of $90^\\text{o}$. The orbitals $f_1\\cdots f_5$ correspond to $d_{x^2-y^2},d_{xy},\\cdots$ as shown in the first two columns.\n",

    "The next step is to use the _projection operator_ to workout which symmetry species each orbital belongs to and this is done using the characters of the point group. This is quite simple but care is needed. We must multiply each element of the first row in table above with each character in the first row of the character table and sum the values. Next, the second row of the character table is multiplied and summed in the same fashion and so on until all symmetry species ($A_1,\\cdots E$) have been operated on by the first row in the table 9.20.1. This is then repeated for each orbital, i.e. each row in the $C_{4V}$ table.\n",

Since we only want to know which orbital belongs to which symmetry species $d/h$ can be ignored. The function $L_M$ is the list of orbital names ($d_{xy}$ etc.) which belong to symmetry species $M$. The simplest way to perform the calculation, and avoid arithmetic slips, is to use some code and use Sympy for symbolic calculation. The matrix F below contains the orbital changes for each operation in $C_{4V}$ and PG is the character table. Matrices AB and Dorb are just for labelling the results.\n",

    "##  6.11 Direct Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Using characters, it is simple to form a direct product of two or more symmetry species. If operators are $\\pmb{A}$ and $\\pmb{B}$, the direct product is written as $\\pmb{A} \\otimes \\pmb{B}$. The symbol $\\otimes $ means calculate the direct product by multiplying pairs of characters together column-wise. One of the other symmetry species of the point group must be produced. If either A or B is the totally symmetric representation, the top line in the table, the result is always the other symmetry species B or A respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the $C_{2V}$ table (see Section 6.9), the product $\\pmb{B}_1 \\otimes \\pmb{B}_2 = \\pmb{A}_2$ as may be seen by multiplying the two elements of symmetry species $B_1$ and $B_2$ column by column and identifying the pattern of characters produced. If two species that are doubly or triply degenerate ($E$ or $T$ Mulliken labels) form a direct product, this has to be reduced in the normal way to a sum of irreducible representations. For example, in $C_{3V}$, figure 15, the direct product $\\pmb{E}\\otimes \\pmb{E}$ produces the result$\\pmb{E}\\otimes \\pmb{E} = 4\\pmb{E} \\oplus \\pmb{C}_3 \\oplus 0\\times\\pmb\\sigma_V$. The symbol $\\oplus$ means the symmetry species are added or, more properly, that $4E,\\, C_3$ but no $\\sigma_V$ are included in $\\pmb{E}\\otimes \\pmb{E}$. It is common in many texts just to use + instead of $\\oplus$. Reducing direct products is explained in Section 6.13, but first one important use of them is illustrated.\n",

    "## 6.12 Allowed and Forbidden transitions. Vanishing Integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spectroscopy of molecules, their symmetry species together with the point group can be used to determine whether an electronic, vibrational, or rotational transition is going to appear in the spectrum. This can be reversed and the presence or absence of lines in a spectrum can sometimes be used to decide geometry. First, the method using the symmetry species is illustrated and then justified by examining the symmetry of the vibrational wavefunctions and normal modes in a molecule. You can simply follow the method illustrated in this first part without having to understand why it works. Finally a connection is made between the transition moment and the symmetry species, i.e. why is it that we can use symmetry to evaluate the integrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition moment $M$ is proportional to the expectation value of the operator for that type of transition.  This can be written for states $a$ and $b$ with wavefunctions $\\psi_a,\\psi_b$ and a transition operator $\\vec{\\mu}$ such as for a vibrational or electronic transition as \n",

    "where $\\tau$ covers all the nuclear/electonic coordinates the wavefunctions may have. The _intensity_ of a transition is $M^2$. The transition operator could be a dipole for absorption/emission or polarisability for Raman transitions. The superscript * indicated a complex conjugate should be taken if the wavefunction is complex but has no effect otherwise. We shall assume that the wavefunctions are real and drop the * from equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetry can be used to determine if the transition moment integral is finite or not, i.e. whether the integral vanishes or not. Only a knowledge of the 'shape' of the wavefunctions and operator are required and no integration is involved and is a sophisticated extension of the odd - even rules to determine if an integral is exactly zero or not. It should be remembered, however, that even if the transition is allowed its intensity may be very small. What the symmetry calculation does is to tell us whether the transition probability is expected to be *exactly zero* or not, and if not it does not tell us anything about what its value will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorption or emission of radiation involves an electric-dipole operator. This will transform as a linear vector in the $x-, y-$, or $z-$direction because it depends linearly on the change in charge distribution that occurs with the transition. The dipole moment is a vector $\\vec{\\mu} = q\\cdot \\vec{r}$ where $q$ is the charge distribution and $\\vec{r}$ the displacement vector during a transition. Raman scattering, however,  depends on having a change in the _polarizability_ of the molecule $\\vec\\alpha$. This is a measure of how easily the electron 'cloud' forming the molecular orbitals changes shape in the presence of the electric field of the radiation. This change is proportional to operators in two dimensions $xy, x^2-y^2$, etc., and these are shown in the last column of the point group table. \n",

A check then has to be made in the point group to identify what species the product belong to, but usually this is done by consulting direct product tables.

    "### **(iii) Connecting the transition moment integral to symmetry species**\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition moment integral has been evaluated using the odd/even nature of wavefunctions and, without explanation, as the product of their symmetry species. In polyatomic molecules a molecular orbital or a normal mode has a complicated mathematical description and it is much easier to use their symmetry properties to decide if the transition is allowed or not. The down-side of this is that the magnitude of the transition is not known, but in practice this is not so important, the presence or otherwise of a transition is usually enough to determine the information we seek, i.e. what a molecule's point group is as this gives clues about its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "An absorption spectrum is a observable quantity and its transitions must have the same energy for all indistinguishable orientations of the molecule. It follows therefore that *any transition moment integral must have the same value for all symmetry operations on the molecule*. For example rotating by $180^\\text{o}$ so that the molecule is indistinguishable from that before the rotation cannot change the molecules energy levels and so cannot change its spectrum. The same is true for all operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  remaining task is to connect the integral eqn. 9.23 with the direct product of the symmetry species of each term in the integral. This removes the task of integrating so that the transition can be determined to be either allowed or forbidden. We therefore want to show that the direct product of the three functions in the integral contains the totally symmetric representation $\\Gamma^1$. \n",

    "To find if the totally symmetric representation occurs in the product $\\Gamma^a\\otimes \\Gamma^\\mu\\otimes \\Gamma^b$ of the irreducible representations $\\Gamma^a,\\Gamma^b$ and $\\Gamma^\\mu$ we use the point group and multiply character by character for each symmetry species $\\Gamma$ and sum over all the classes. This is very similar to the method given below (section 6.13) to reduce a representation. The sum is\n",

    "\n",
    "The intersystem crossing transition between a singlet excited state to a triplet state is formally forbidden but may occur because of spin-orbit coupling allowing a change in angular momentum to occur. Transitions are  enhanced by heavy atoms, often called the 'heavy-atom effect', however, paramagnetic species, such as O$_2$ also enhance spin-orbit coupling. The spin-orbit operator has the form $H_{SO}\\sim \\pmb\\ell\\cdot \\pmb s$ where $\\pmb\\ell$ and $ \\pmb s$ are the orbital and spin angular momentum vectors respectively. In terms of symmetry the spin-orbit operator transforms as $R_k,k={x,y,z}$ and appears in column 3 in the point group table. \n",

    "The spin orbit operator belongs to the same irreducible representation as $R_k,k={x,y,z}$ which means for an allowed transition the product $\\Gamma_S\\otimes R_k\\otimes\\Gamma_T$ must contain the totally symmetric representation, $A_1,A_g$ etc. for any $x,y,z$.  When singlet and triplet have the same configuration then $\\Gamma_S=\\Gamma_T$ and thus for a transition $S\\to T $ to be allowed the spin-orbit operator $R_k$ must belong to the totally symmetric representation. Examining the point group tables shows that molecules in $C_{nV}, D_{nh} D_{nd}$ and a few other point groups do not have a $R_k$ operator that is totally symmetric so $S\\to T$ transitions cannot occur by spin-orbit coupling in molecule of these point groups, i.e. are formally forbidden and hence occur very slowly. It is, of course, possible that $^1\\pi\\pi^*$ and $^3\\pi\\pi^*$ belong to different symmetry species and then the $S\\to T$ transition may be allowed if there is a suitable symmetry species for $R_k$, but in practice the rate constant is still small compared to $\\pi\\pi^* \\rightleftharpoons n\\pi^*$ transitions.

In benzene the transition from the ground state to the first excited state $^1S_0(A_{1g})\\to\\, ^1S_1(B_{2u})$ is forbidden but this transition becomes weakly allowed because a vibration of $e_g$ symmetry species (in the $D_{6h}$ point group) can change the ground or excited state geometry. This forms the new symmetry of the ground state and the method outlined above is used to determine if the transition is allowed. The intensity of the transition is borrowed, or 'stolen' from an allowed transition nearby in energy and with the same symmetry as the vibrationally modified state. If this electronic state is present the symmetry may be suitable but the transition intensity can still be minute if in the energy gap to the allowed transition is large. \n",

    "## 6.14 Normal Mode vibrations\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal mode is one of a set of the elementary vibrations of any vibrating object and is fundamental to understanding vibrations of any kind, whether in the engine or suspension of a car, in a washing machine, in a guitar string or in a molecule. If you were able to see a molecule, other than a diatomic, and watch the motion of the atoms, they would appear to be moving rather chaotically. However, to a good approximation it is always possible to assume that the complicated vibrations of any body can be broken down into a set of normal modes and then each of the individual stretching and bending normal motions of a molecule would be apparent. Rather than concentrating on the motion of one atom at a time, the motion of several together is considered and if we get this right, the motion will be that of one of the normal modes. This would, in effect, be a transformation from viewing the molecule in lab $xyz$ coordinates, to viewing internal coordinates based on the motions of these several atoms and there is, fortunately, a systematic way of finding them. In any molecule, all the atoms are coupled through their bonds and in a normal mode, all the atoms move with the same frequency, have fixed amplitude ratios and fixed phase relationships between them. Unless the normal mode is, by symmetry, degenerate with another, each normal mode has a unique frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetry of a normal mode is described by one of the irreducible representations in the molecule's point group. The fact that a symmetry label can be attached to a normal mode encapsulates the idea of collective synchronized motion; some examples are given below for a planar molecule such as HBF$_2$. Notice that it is possible to have different normal mode displacements, and consequently vibrational frequencies, but with the same\n",
    "overall symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first normal mode shown in figure 23 belongs to symmetry species $A_1$ and each atom is moved in such a way as to stretch each bond in phase with the other. If the molecule were HBF$_2$, the centre of mass is below the atom labelled $x$ on a line from $z \\to x$. In the bottom right of the figure, the $B_1$ mode has atoms moving together, but the central atom moves into the plane of the figure while the other three atoms move out, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "No external force can act on a molecule due solely to its vibrational motion; therefore, no extra displacement or rotation of the molecule can occur during normal mode vibrations and the centre of mass must remain in the same place. If there are N masses (atoms) connected by forces (chemical bonds), then there are $3N$ modes in a three-dimensional object. However, because we want vibrational normal modes, we have to remove three modes due to translation and three for rotation (two if the molecule is linear) as we are not interested in the whole body's rotation or translation. This leaves $3N - 6$ vibrational normal modes for polyatomic molecules and $3N - 5$ for linear ones.\n",

    "Group theory plays an important part in working out what spectroscopic transitions can occur in a molecule, and this was outlined in Section 7.6.12. In addition, it can be used to work out what the normal mode symmetry species are going to be. Recall that a normal mode is the collective motion of the atoms in a molecule such that a constant phase relationship is maintained between them; see Figs 27, 78, and 79. Often these are characterized as symmetric stretch, asymmetric stretch, and bending vibrations, which is fine in a small molecule, such as SO$_2$ or water. However, in larger molecule the vibrational motion becomes more complex and cannot be so simply described, but is instead characterized as a symmetry species of the molecule. The normal mode vibrations are given by the Mulliken labels listed in the left-hand column of the point group but usually with a lower case letter, e.g. $b_{2g}$ rather than $B_{2g}$.\n",

The two reflections are worked out similarly to rotation. Reflection in the $x-z$ plane leaves $x$ and $z$ unchanged making six in total but each $y$ is inverted therefore the character for the $\\sigma(x,z)$ is $3$.

    "## 6.16 Determining the shapes of Normal Mode vibrations and molecular orbitals using Projection Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Having obtained the symmetry species of vibrations or molecular orbitals it is natural to want to see what these look like and to do this projection operators are used. What these operators do is to extract the symmetry adapted functions from the basis functions used to form them and so produce a linear combination L of the basis functions. Many basis functions can be chosen, but the easiest to use are usually vectors pointing along bonds or those representing a $p\\pi$ orbital. To form a linear combination, a 'victim' vector is chosen and operated on with each symmetry operation in the point group, $C_2, \\sigma(xz)$, etc. to find what vector this turns into. This vector's name (the basis function) is then multiplied with the character from the point group corresponding to that symmetry operation and symmetry species. Finally, the names are added together by moving from one symmetry operation to the next along the top row of the point group. We expect the result to be the sum or difference of the displacement vectors for a molecular vibration, such as $2v_1 + v_2 - v_3 \\cdots$ and so forth. The same formula or algorithm is used if the combinations of atomic orbitals that make up molecular orbitals are sought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation 9.21 in section 9.6.5 shows how to generate the projection operator. In the $C_{3V}$ point group, for example, there is a heading $2C_3$ as there are two members in this class, and this must be split in the summation into $C_3^+$ and $C_3^-$. This is because moving a vector $120^ \\text{o}$ to the right, say, will turn it into a different vector than turning $120^\\text{o}$ to the left, similarly, any mirror planes must be separated out. The character for symmetry species $M$ is $c_j$ and $O^S_j(v)$ is the effect that operator $O^S$ in column $j$ of the point group has on our victim vector $v$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this operation is to produce a vector whose _name_ is recorded. For example, if $O^S$ is the identity then the result is $E_1(v) = v$, other operations may leave $v$ unchanged or change it into another vector. Finally, note that if the reduced representation of the vibrations or molecular orbitals contains two or more symmetry species of the same type, e.g. $2A_1$, then two or more different victim vectors will have to be chosen to obtain all the linear combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In H$_2$O, SO$_2$, and other triatomics with $C_{2V}$ symmetry, it is clear that two of the vibrational modes stretch the bonds and one changes the bond angle.

If more than one orbital is present with a particular symmetry, the orbitals will mix and a secular equation is set up to find their energies, provided that the orbitals are made orthogonal first. This can be done with a Gram - Schmidt method and the results normalized. The molecular orbitals each have the form $\\psi = a_1\\varphi_1 + a_2\\varphi_2 + b_3\\varphi_3 + \\cdots + b_n\\varphi_n$ where $\\varphi$ are the atomic orbitals and a are the coefficients found using the projection operator method just described.
