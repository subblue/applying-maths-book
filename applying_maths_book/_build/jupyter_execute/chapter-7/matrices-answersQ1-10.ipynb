    "The only change that has to be made in the case of benzene compared to the linear 1, 3, 5-hexatriene, is to add 1 to the matrix in the $(1, 6)$ and $(6, 1)$ positions, or $(1, n)$ and $(n, 1)$ generally. The calculation is the same as in Algorithm 1, but with $n=6$ because there are six carbon atoms each with one $\\pi$ electron, and changes to the two extreme elements, top right, bottom left, to unity from zero, to make the benzene structure cyclic. This can be done with a line added outside and after the last end do; to link the first to last atoms."

The integral $\\beta$ is a negative quantity, therefore the total energy for three electrons is $3\\alpha + 2\\sqrt{2}\\beta$ and the stabilization energy is therefore $2\\sqrt{2}\\beta$ compared to that of three non-bonded electrons with a total energy $3\\alpha$.\n",

The total energy of the three electrons is therefore $3\\alpha + 3\\beta$ making the stabilization energy $3\\beta$. As this is slightly larger than $2\\sqrt{2}\\beta$ the triangular form is expected to be the most stable. In the real molecule, the energy between the linear and triangular form is quite small and the triangular form is distorted by Jahn-Teller interaction and is not an isosceles triangle but an obtuse one. The linear structure was calculated by an _ab initio_ method to be approximately $13$ kJ mol$^{-1}$ higher in energy than the triangular one (Martin & Davidson 1988).\n",

The exact value of $\\beta$ does not matter as long as it is negative; the energy is then in units of $\\beta$. The lowest energy is $2E_m + E_1$ and this is shown as $E_T$ at the bottom of the figure, and illustrates that the bent form of the molecule has the lowest energy. However the model is unrealistic at a smaller angle that $60^\\text{o}$ as here repulsion must increase the energy as the bond will become shorter than the equilibrium value. The change in energy with angle above $60^\\text{o}$ is small but this may not be realistic in view of the crudeness of the model. All that can be concluded is that the bent form is lower in energy that the straight one. As an exercise, recalculate the energy where the angular dependence is put in the form $b_\\theta = 2 - 2 \\sin(\\theta/2)$, which has a value of $1$ at $60^\\text{o}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now there are more than enough terms to try to relate these formulae to one another. If the suggested formula in the question is correct, then starting with $f_1$ and $f_2$ the recursion formula suggests that $f_3(x) = xf_2(x) - f_1(x)$. Using the values above $f_3(x) = x(x^2 - 1) - x$, which is the same equation as the characteristic equation calculated from the Huckel determinant for propene. The formula seems to be correct at least for these two terms. We can calculate another term as a check. For example, $f_5(x) = xf_4(x) - f_3(x)$ which is also correct, and as both examples work, this sufficient to 'prove' the recursion formula $f_n(x) = xf_{n-1}(x) - f_{n-2}(x)$.\n",

    "Numerically solving the equations rather than factoring as above, and plotting the results, shows how the energy levels change as the number of carbon atoms and hence $\\pi$ electrons increases. As the number of levels increase more energy levels (states), appear to have large positive and negative values and fewer at zero energy. When the number of electrons becomes very large, as in a semiconductor, the levels merge into a band and then relatively more energy levels appear at the band edges than at the band centre. This is the trend that is seen to be starting here. All the levels below zero are filled and as the molecule gets longer the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO orbitals becomes very small, rather line this of a 1D metal. \n",
