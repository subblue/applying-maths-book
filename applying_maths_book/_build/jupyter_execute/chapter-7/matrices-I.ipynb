    "### 14 Molecular vibrations\n",
    "Matrix eigenvalue - eigenvector problems can also be used to solve a number of related problems such as molecular vibrations, coupled pendulums, and damped oscillators. When the displacements from equilibrium are small the equations produced are linear, and this is always assumed in solving these equations with matrix methods. The numerical methods of Chapter 11 allow the fully non-linear equations to be solved. In this section, the concept of normal modes is described first, then the motion of linked pendulums, and finally the vibrational motion of molecules is described and some examples worked through.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the initial displacements made to the atoms of a molecule correspond to that expected of any one of the normal modes, Figure 23, then the oscillations of all atoms continue only in that normal mode. The first reason is because each atom is connected to all others via chemical bonds, and second because each normal mode is orthogonal to every other one. This means that, ideally, no energy flows from one normal mode to any other, and although this happens in practice, for example due to an harmonicity, it need not concern us here. If an arbitrary initial displacement is made that does not correspond to that expected of a normal mode, a complicated motion results. However, this can always be decomposed to a linear combination or sum of the normal modes, taken in various proportions as necessary to describe the motion. The overall motion, when many modes are simultaneously excited, causes beating; this is particularly clear in a coupled pendulum as the two pendulums come into and go out of phase with one another. This is seen when one of the pendulum bobs becomes stationary for an instance while its partner swings maximally; this then loses energy and becomes instantaneously stationary while the other has gained maximum displacement and which continues by swapping energy _ad infinitum_.\n",

    "### 14.2 Calculation of normal modes\n",
    "\n",
    "In a mechanical or molecular vibration, we usually try to find the equation relating forces. In simple harmonic motion, such as stretching a chemical bond, the potential energy is by Hooke's law, $V = ks^2/2$, where $k$ is the force constant and $s$ the amount the bond extends away from its equilibrium length. The force $f$ to stretch the bond, is obtained by differentiation of $\\displaystyle f=-\\frac{dV}{ds}=-ks$ and is also given by Newton's second law; force = mass $\\times$ acceleration, $\\displaystyle f=m\\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$ which provides the connection to time. Equating the two terms produces the equation of motion for small displacements from equilibrium, viz.\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}+\\frac{k}{m}s=0 \\tag{46}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to find out what $k/m$ represents. By knowing that the motion of the pendulum is periodic, we may assume that the displacement at any time is described by $s = u\\cos(\\omega t + \\varphi)$, where $\\omega$ is an angular frequency, $\\varphi$ is the phase, $t$ is time, and $u$ is the amplitude of the motion. The phase is arbitrary, and can be set to zero. Differentiating s twice by time and multiplying by m to obtain the force gives\n",

    "\n",
    "By comparison with equation 46, the (angular) oscillation frequency is $\\omega =\\sqrt{k/m}$, and is in radians s$^{-1}$. A similar equation describes the oscillation of a pendulum, but now the angular frequency is $\\omega = \\sqrt{g/L}$ if $L$ is the length of the pendulum and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is more than one oscillator - for instance, two coupled pendulums or the many vibrations of a polyatomic molecule - there is one force equation for each mass in the molecule. The potential $V$ for atom 1 now has terms not only describing its own position, but also of all others connected to it, and could contain terms with each of $s_1, s_2, \\cdots$ etc., where $s$ is the displacement of any atom. The equations are therefore coupled and when placed into a matrix form there are off-diagonal force-terms that are not zero;\n",

    "The $k$'s in the square matrix are the forces or negative derivatives of the potential energy with respect to each displacement $s_1, s_2, \\cdots$.

    "\n",
    "The next step in the calculation is to write down the equation of motion of the normal modes. Each normal mode has, by definition, its own frequency $\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\cdots$ and so forth. Occasionally modes are degenerate, but nevertheless, by analogy with a single oscillator, each normal mode has an equation of the form $\\displaystyle \\frac{d^2s_n}{dt^2} + \\omega^2s_n = 0$, where $s_n$ is the coordinate describing the displacement of the normal mode and is not the same as $s_1$ or $s_2$ etc. used above.

Once the eigenvalues are obtained, they form a diagonal matrix and, term by term, are equal to the diagonal matrix of squared frequencies. If the eigenvectors are also obtained, their symmetry gives the pattern of displacements, by which is meant that, if all the values in an eigenvector are the same, the motion is all in one direction and, if different, then some masses are moving in one direction and other masses in other directions as determined by the sign.\n",

    "Using the matrix method to solve problems of this type is best described with an example. The most difficult part is always obtaining the equation for the energy and therefore forces. In this example, the motion of two identical pendulums will be calculated. They have length $L$ and mass $m$ at the end of rigid, mass-less rods, and the masses are coupled together with a spring with force constant $k$, Figure 59. The pendulums are initially at equilibrium separated by the un-extended length of the spring, and then energy is added by moving one or both of the individual pendulums by a very small amount so that Hooke's law for the spring is obeyed, and the change in potential, due to height, is directly proportional to the change in the vertical angle. There are two normal modes, see Figure 60. Either the pendulums swing together in phase both moving in the same direction at constant separation, or they move together and apart stretching and compressing the spring. These are clearly the only possible motions of the two pendulums for small angular motion and we shall want to find out their frequency (eigenvalues) and the normal mode displacements using the eigenvectors.\n",

    "This method is rather abstract but can be made less so by working through an example. We will calculate some of the normal modes of a linear triatomic molecule, such as CO$_2$, by considering just the motion along the line of atoms, as shown in Figure 61. A linear molecule is chosen to make the calculation simpler; a bent molecule such as H$_2$O or SO$_2$ can be calculated in a similar manner, but the algebra in calculating the potential is more complex. An example is given at the end.  Herzberg gives several examples including different possible models of the potentials that can be used; Herzberg (1964, vol II, Chapter 2).\n",

    "It is normally assumed that the motion of the atoms is harmonic and we additionally assume that the only force constants are those between adjacent atoms; this is equivalent to assuming that the valence bond model describes the bonding. A molecular orbital model would consider forces constants between one atom and every other atom. The calculation will be done in two ways. First directly, as in Section 14.2 but using mass weighting from the start; then secondly, using python with the $\\pmb{GFG}$ matrix method which introduces mass weighting in the $\\pmb{GFG}$ product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first calculation uses mass-weighted coordinates and force constants. This means that the displacements $s$ of atom $i$ are modified to become $q_i =s_i\\sqrt{m_i}$, and force constants between atoms $i$ and $j$ become $\\displaystyle K_{ij}=\\frac{k_{ij}}{\\sqrt{m_im_j}}$ as in equation 76.\n",

    "The starting point is to calculate the potential energy and, from this, the forces on the atoms. As the molecule is symmetrical, there is only one force constant, but the mass-weighted force constants will be different. The normal modes for a simple molecule can easily be sketched, and two of them are shown in Fig. 7.62. The molecule is linear giving $3N - 5$ or $4$ modes in total, the other two are the degenerate bending motion in the plane of the page. One where the carbon atom moves down and the two oxygen atoms move up and then vice versa. The other bending normal mode is the similar motion but perpendicular to the plane of the page.\n",

The relative motion is $s_1 = s_3 = 0.115Q_2$ to $s_2 = -0.308Q_2$ so the carbon atom moves further than the oxygen atoms do, which is not surprising, because the centre of mass has to be held constant and the C atom has to compensate for the motion of two O atoms.

    "## Moments of Inertia\n",
    "\n",
    "Angular momentum plays a central role in chemistry, but this is usually in the context of nuclear and electron spin; for example, nuclear spin gives rise to NMR and electron spin (EPR) spectroscopies, as well as being essential for the formation of the chemical bond. The rotation of whole molecules is a natural consequence of thermal motion and is observed with microwave, infrared, Terahertz, or Raman spectroscopy. These techniques are used to measure the spacing between a molecule's rotational energy levels. This is described next, followed by a brief description of angular momentum and moments of inertia. Finally, the calculation of bond lengths is described.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.1 The rotational motion of molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "The collision between molecules in the gas phase and at the prevailing temperature equilibrates the energy among translation, vibration, and rotational motions. A molecule can only have discrete values of vibrational or rotational energy. The lowest rotational energy is zero, and the energy levels become more widely spaced as the quantum number $J$ is increased. The equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle E_j=\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}J(J+1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "describes the rotational energy, in joules, of a (rigid rotor) diatomic or linear molecule, with quantum number $J = 0, 1, 2, \\cdots$. The multiplicity and also degeneracy of a rotational level with quantum number $J$, is $g_J = 2J + 1$. The constant $I$ is the moment of inertia, and is typically $\\approx10^{-45}\\;\\mathrm{kg\\,m^2}$ for a molecule. It is this small, because a molecule's mass is small, and its bond lengths short. An apple has a value $I \\approx 10^{-4}\\;\\mathrm{kg\\,m^2}$ and a lorry's wheel $\\approx 10\\;\\mathrm{kg\\,m^2}$. As we shall see the moment of inertia is related to a bond length.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rotational constant is defined as $B=\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$ making the energy $E_J=BJ(J+1)$. Remembering that a joule is a unit of energy with base units of mass $\\times$ velocity squared, the constant $B$ has units\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle B=\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}\\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{J^2\\,s^2}}{\\mathrm{kg\\,m^2}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{kg^2\\,m^4\\,s^{-4}s^2}}{\\mathrm{kg\\,m^2}}= \\mathrm{kg\\,m^2\\,s^{-2}}=\\mathrm{J}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, however, $B$ is expressed in units of wavenumbers (cm$^{-1}$) produced by dividing $B$ by $100hc$; the factor $100c$ is used because $c$ has units of m s$^{-1}$ and we want units in cm$^{-1}$; $\\displaystyle B=\\frac{1}{100hc}\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotational constant $B$ has a value that is typically less than a wavenumber. Its largest value, $\\approx 64 \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, is for H$_2$, but clearly this is not typical, as this is the lightest molecule. Once the rotational spectrum is measured, it is easy to measure $B$, because the lines (in a diatomic ) are spaced by $2B$. In real molecules, things are more complex, because of centrifugal distortion in the rotating molecule, but this effect is small for low $J$ quantum numbers and does not fundamentally change our analysis. The last step is to calculate the bond length from $I$. At one time, this was the main purpose of microwave spectroscopy, but nowadays, bond lengths of very many small molecules have been accurately measured. The technique is now more often used analytically, for example, to identify species in interstellar dust clouds, or to monitor the ethene produced by ripening fruit.\n",

    "### 15.2 Angular momentum and moment of inertia\n",
    "\n",
    "The angular momentum of a solid body is the momentum caused by virtue of its rotational motion and is a vector quantity. In an isolated molecule, this motion is about the centre of mass, also called the centre of gravity. The angular momentum produced has a fixed direction in space. In general, it is just as possible to cause the rotational motion of an object to be about its end as it is about its middle. A rod can be spun about its centre, along its axis, or about its end, and each angular momentum will be different. If the body rotates with angular frequency {, the angular momentum $\\pmb{L}$ is given by $\\pmb{L} = \\pmb{I\\omega}$, where $\\pmb{I}$ is a matrix of moment of inertia values and $\\pmb{L}$ and { are one-dimensional matrices or vectors. The reason for the vector quantities is that a body can move in three dimensions and the motion can be split into components along three axes. The moment of inertia of (rigidly connected) masses, where each has mass $m_i$, is $I = \\sum_i m_ir_i^2$ where $r_i$ is the _perpendicular_ distance of mass $i$ from an axis. In fact, we can choose the axes to be anywhere we want so the moment of inertia depends on where these axes are placed; it is therefore not a fundamental property of an object. This presents a problem if we are to try to calculate bond lengths, because different values would be obtained depending on where the axes are placed. The obvious place is to locate the axes at the centre of mass since a freely rotating object will rotate about this point. However, in what directions the axes point relative to the molecule has still to be chosen. Very often, we may choose to align the axes with some symmetry axis of the molecule. The molecule will always rotate about its own inertial axes and if these two sets of axes do not coincide, and they usually do not, the moments of inertia will have the form of a matrix with terms that depend on where an atom is with respect to any two axes, $I_{xy}, I_{yz}$ etc. All is not lost, however, because there is a simple way to rotate our chosen axes onto the molecule's inertial axes, making the moment of inertia matrix, diagonal. This will be described in Section 15.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total kinetic energy of a rigid body is that due to its linear plus rotational energy. The linear kinetic energy is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle E_{lin} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\n",

    "and the rotational kinetic energy \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle E_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "thus, the moment of inertia $I$, takes the place of the mass used to describe linear motion and angular velocity $\\omega$ (radians s$^{-1}$), replaces linear velocity $\\pmb{v}$ in m s$^{-1}$. Similarly, linear momentum $\\pmb{p}= m\\pmb{v}$, is replaced by angular momentum $\\pmb{L} = I\\pmb{\\omega}$, which is also vector quantity. The angular momentum relative to the centre of mass about an axis at the centre of a rigid disc of mass $m$, is shown in Figure 53 and is $\\pmb{L}= m \\pmb{r}\\times \\pmb{v}$ where $\\pmb{v}$ is the velocity of the edge of the disc and $\\pmb{r}$ its radius vector. The angular momentum points in the direction away from you, if the disc rotates clockwise when you look at its underside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angular velocity is, by definition, the rate of change of the angle $\\theta$ the rigid body moves through, and has units of radians / second. It can be shown that the velocity vector $\\pmb{v}$ in the centre-of-mass coordinate system is related to the angular velocity $\\pmb{\\omega}$ as\n",

    "\n",
    "where $I_{xy}=I_{yx} $ etc. Calculating each of these terms is described in Section 13.4. The angular momentum is always proportional to the angular velocity; the proportionality is the moment of inertia, and hence the emphasis falls on calculating this. Sometimes, the angular momentum matrix is called the angular momentum _tensor_.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize: A molecule or other solid object will rotate about its own inertial (principal) axes that are fixed in space. The geometrical axes we chose to place on the molecule need not be coincident with the inertial axes, in fact, they are usually not, and therefore the inertial matrix has off-diagonal elements. Should the inertial and geometrical axes coincide, only the diagonal values exist. By diagonalizing the inertial matrix, the two sets of axes are made coincident, and the diagonal moments of inertia of the principal or inertial axes can be calculated.\n",

    "The moment of inertia is not an intrinsic property of a body but depends upon the axis about which the moment is taken.
