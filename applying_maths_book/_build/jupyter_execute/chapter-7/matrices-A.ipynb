    "Matrices are represented by square $[\\cdots]$ or round $( )$ brackets surrounding the block of numbers; determinants always by straight lines $||$and sometimes a pair of double straight lines $|| \\;||$. The following matrix has $m = 4$ rows and $n = 3$ columns. The elements of any matrix or determinant are referenced with two subscripts, so, if the matrix $A$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns, i.e. an $m \\times n$ matrix, the $mn^{th}$ element is written as $A_{mn}$ and the indexing is always row by column. The diagonal is only present in a square matrix or determinant and is the series of terms from top left to bottom right that have the same indices, e.g., $a_{22}$. The anti-diagonal passes from top right to bottom left.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the $\\mathrm{H\\overset{\\cdot\\cdot}uckel }$ molecular orbital approximation $\\pi$ bonding energies of molecules, ions, and radicals can be calculated. This method reflects the topology of the structure because only adjacent atoms interact with one another, and the change in energy with the length or angle of bonds is not included in the calculation. In this model of $\\pi$ bonding, each electron in a $\\pi$ orbital interacts only with $\\pi$ electrons on the nearest atoms. This interaction energy is calculated from the resonance (exchange) Coulomb energy integral, is conventionally given the symbol $\\beta$, and is _negative_ since interaction is attractive. It has a value $\\approx -300$  kJ/mole, although estimates vary widely. The $\\pi$ electrons on any atom also have their own energy, which is the Coulomb self-energy integral, and this is labelled $\\alpha$. The interaction energies can be made into a determinant, called the secular determinant$^*$, and which is then solved to find the energy. This determinant is formed by a set of simple rules; why it works is explained later on in Section 12.3 that describes eigenvalue - eigenvector equations, in particular the Secular equation, eqn. 32.\n",

    "**(2)**$\\quad$ Each diagonal element has the energy $\\alpha - E$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3)**$\\quad$ Each $\\pi$ electron when connected to a nearest neighbour has interaction energy $\\beta$. The basis set labelling determines where these go in the determinant. Using the labels starting as indicated in Figure 3, atoms $0-1, 1-2, 2-3$ only have interaction energy $\\beta$, which means that $\\beta$ is entered at these positions in the determinant and the corresponding positions to make the determinant symmetrical. The reason for this is that interaction $0-1$ is the same as $1-0$ which makes the determinant Hermitian; see Section 4.9.\n",

    "We could solve the determinant by hand and then attempt to solve the quartic equation also by hand by factoring out terms or perhaps by plotting the function and looking for its roots where $x = 0$. The Newton - Raphson method could also be used to find roots numerically and until recently, this would have been done. Instead, with Python the construction and solution of the $\\mathrm{H\\overset{\\cdot\\cdot}uckel }$ determinant is straightforward. The matrix can be constructed manually or the scheme below can be used which will make the $\\mathrm{H\\overset{\\cdot\\cdot}uckel }$ determinant for any linear polyene. "

The electronic Schroedinger equation calculates the energy of the electrons at a fixed nuclear separation, i.e. after the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is invoked. This approximation is made to simplify the equations and is valid as the mass of the electron is far less than that of a proton or neutron and so the electrons can realise their minimum energy without being influenced any change in the motion of the nuclei. A potential energy surface is then made by repeatedly solving at different but fixed nuclear positions, i.e. the electronic energy is minimized in the field of the point charges of the nuclei.
