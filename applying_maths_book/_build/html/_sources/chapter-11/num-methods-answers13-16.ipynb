    "Using the algorithms in the text the following figure can be produced from which it is clear that both the Euler methods fail badly in this instance and even the Runge - Kutta fails when $t$ is large. If the number of integration points is increased to $1000$, the Euler methods improve slightly but still fail, however, the Runge - Kutta is essentially identical to the exact solution but only up to about $t=15$ when it starts to fail badly. This illustrates how difficult, and time consuming numerical calculations can be. Time consuming since very small steps may be needed to ensure accuracy.\n",

    "In the figure we see that the product concentration $[P]$ rises to reach the same concentration as the substrate concentration $[S_0]$ and that the enzyme E after initially reacting returns to its initial concentration $ [E_0]$. The substrate concentration falls rapidly to begin with, then more slowly. This is due to establishing the equilibrium between S + E and ES and therefore ES initially rises rapidly and reached a maximum and falls because it is slowly lost to product. The steady state condition is  $d[ES]/dt = 0$ is only approximately satisfied with these rate constants after ES has reached its maximum and extends only to about two seconds. The calculation clearly shows the approximate nature of the steady state approximation, we assume that the gradient is zero but have to be satisfied that it is small. Notice also that the steady state conditions mean that the concentration of the species ES need not be small, just that its gradient with time is small. This is a common misconception in the steady state approach.\n",
