A tangent, for example, is the ratio of sine/cosine and is treated as a ratio. Others functions such as sec(x) which is 1/cos(x) can be treated as a function of a function, Section 5.1, either in the trig or exponential form.

    "The general result for the $n^{th}$ derivative of $x^m$ is $\\displaystyle \\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}=\\frac{m!}{(m-n)!}x^{m-n}$ which can be generalised if $n$ is a fraction by changing the factorials to gamma functions as $n!=\\Gamma (n+1)$ thus $\\displaystyle \\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}=\\frac{\\Gamma (m+1)}{\\Gamma(m-n+1)}x^{m-n}$. As many functions can be expressed as power series it is possible to fractionally differentiate these. However, these unusual derivatives need not have more than a curiosity interest for us; they appear in Morse's paper on the anharmonic oscillator (P. Morse, Physical Review, 34, 57, 1929) and hardly anywhere else."
