    "Differentiation allows us to obtain the 'slope', or gradient, of a function, or the rate of change of some quantity with time. Integration allows us to obtain the area under a curve, and this is described fully in the next chapter. Differentiation and integration are shown in pictorial form below for any regular function $f(x)$. By regular is meant a well-behaved function without discontinuities at some value of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differential of the function produces the gradient at the point specified, a in Fig. 1, and clearly by moving a along the axis to the right the slope will vary from its negative value, as shown, become zero, when the line is horizontal at the bottom of the curve, and then become positive. The definite integral is the area between $a$ and $b$ and clearly grows or shrinks if $b$ is moved along the _x_-axis with a fixed in place. When evaluated the integral is a number.\n",

Integrating $df/dx$ is equivalent to solving a differential equation and these are met primarily in chemical kinetics, quantum mechanics, and dynamics. Before working out the details of differentiation, the effect that a small change in $x$ and $y$ has on an expression is examined, and this will lead naturally into differentiation.\n",

    "\n",
    "A straight line with equation $y = mx + c$ has a constant slope $m$, which is the change in $y$ divided by change in $x$, or $\\delta y/\\delta x$ for any interval $\\delta x$. However, most functions are more interesting than the straight line; a parabola for example, $y = mx^2 + c$, has a gradient that changes with $x$ and the value $\\delta y/\\delta x$ is now clearly going to depend upon how small $\\delta x$ and $\\delta y$ are and where $x$ is on the curve. If $\\delta x$ is made infinitesimally small, the gradient exactly at position $x$ is obtained and this is what is achieved with differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fig. 3.2, the curve is a parabola with the equation $y = x^2 + 1$. The slope in the region P to Q is $\\delta y/\\delta x$. The point P has coordinates $(2, 5)$ and if $\\delta x = 0.3$ then the point Q is $(x, y) = (2.3, 2.32 + 1)$, making $\\delta y = 1.29$ and $\\delta y/\\delta x = 4.3$. Similarly, the slope can be calculated starting at any other point on the curve. As $\\delta x$ is small but finite, the gradient is the average over the range $\\delta x$, and if $f(x)$ is any (normal) function such as $x^2 + 1$, then its slope is given by\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous section, the effect a small change $\\delta x$ on a quantity $x$ was calculated, now $\\delta x$ is made infinitesimally small and the limit found when $\\delta x \\to  0$. The consequence of making the change $\\delta x \\to  0$ is profound and leads to differentiation, which is of universal application. If [C] is concentration, differentiation with time gives the _rate_ of a chemical reaction, or if $x$ is position, differentiation gives the speed of the body: rate of change of distance with time. A derivative in general describes the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another and 'rate of change' is commonly used not only to mean change with time, its original meaning, but also of any quantity with respect to another; $dy/dx$ for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function has a value $y = f(x)$ at $x$ and at a nearby point $x + \\delta x$ its value is $y + \\delta y = f(x + \\delta x)$, then the slope is approximately $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}=\\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}$ provided that $\\delta x \\ne 0$. To find the gradient exactly at the point $x$, $\\delta x$ must tend to zero; $\\delta x \\to  0$, which means finding the limit of the equation, and at the limit $\\delta$ is changed to $d$ and the derivative of the function is written in mathematical notation as $dy/dx$ . \n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative can be written in a number of different ways besides $\\displaystyle \\frac{dy}{dx}$, although this is by far the most common. The following forms are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\begin{align}\\frac{dy}{dx}=  \\lim_{\\delta x \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+\\delta x)-f(x)}{\\delta x}&\\equiv \\lim_{\\delta x \\to 0} \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x}\\\\\n",

    "The derivative $df/dx$ is the _gradient of the function_ $f(x)$ _at point_ $x$. The gradient is also the tangent to the curve at the point $x$; a line at right angles to the tangent is called the _normal_ to the curve, Fig. 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few sections simple functions are differentiated and the methods for dealing with products of these functions and more complex cases are described.

    "\n",
    "In finding the limit $\\delta x \\to  0$ although $f(x + \\delta x) - f(x)$ and $\\delta x$ tend to zero, their  ratio does not and is finite. Even though this may not seem to make sense, it is true also for many ordinary functions, such as $\\sin(x)$, $x^2$, and so forth. For example, choosing two equations $y_1 = 3x$ and $y_2 =2x$ as $x\\to  0$, both $y_1$ and $y_2$ tend to zero, but their ratio is $3x/2x=3/2$ for all values except exactly at $x  = 0$. The similar effect is seen in a triangle because the ratio of the length of the base to the perpendicular side is constant except at exactly $x  = 0$, fig. 4.\n",

    "\n",
    "The gradient of $y = x^2$ will clearly change with the value of $x$ being negative when $x \\lt  0$, zero at $x = 0$, and increasingly positive with increase in $x$. See Fig. 2. Let us consider a point at $\\delta x$ larger than $x$ then $y+\\delta y=(x+\\delta x)^2$ and therefore $\\delta y=2x\\delta x+δx^2$ so that $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\delta y}{\\delta x} =2x+\\delta x$ which is the average gradient in the region $x \\to x + \\delta x$. Next, making $\\delta x$ smaller and smaller to evaluate the limit, $\\delta x\\to $ 0 produces the result,\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes $d/dx$ is called the _differential operator_ because it operates on $x^2$ to form 2$x$, which is the gradient at any point $x$. Now that $x^2$ has been differentiated, returning to equation (2) where an approximate gradient of $4.3$ was found for the parabola the true value at $x  = 2$ is $4$ so our estimate was reasonable but still about $7$% out, however, it was more difficult to calculate than the exact value!\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle C+\\delta C=C_0e^{-k(t+\\delta t)} = C_0e^{-kt}e^{-k\\delta t}$$\n",
