    "The nitrogen in ammonia is sp$^3$ hybridized with a lone pair of electrons taking up the fourth position; if there were a proton on this position making NH$_4^+$ the point group would be tetrahedral. Two views of ammonia are shown in Fig. 7.78. In the left figure the third mirror plane is in line with the axis and not visible behind the other two.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the right-hand view it is clear that the molecule has a threefold axis, the molecule can be rotated by $120^\\text{o}$, a $C_3^+$ operation, or by $-120^\\text{o}$ a $C_3^-$ operation, to become indistinguishable. There is no horizontal mirror plane or $C_2$ axes, but there are three vertical mirror planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To form the product table, products $C_3^+ \\otimes C_3^-$ and $C_3 \\otimes \\sigma_V$ etc. have to be evaluated this way as well as the other way round. There are two ways at least of doing this; one is geometric, the other algebraic and is to define a basis set and to work out the matrix for each operation and then to multiply them together. To use the geometrical method the H atoms have to be labelled so that they can be distinguished as shown in figure 78.\n",

    "The effect of $C_3^+ \\otimes C_3^-$ is first to move atom H$_1$ by one place ($120^\\text{o}$) to H$_2$ then to move it back, therefore making the molecule identical $E$; as an equation $C_3^+ \\otimes C_3^- = E$. The reversed multiplication order produces the same result. In two consecutive $C_3$ operations, the first moves H$_1$ by one place and the second does the same producing a total rotation of $240^\\text{o}$ or $C_3^+ \\otimes C_3^+ =C_3^-$. Now consider a rotation and reflection; $C_3^+ \\otimes \\sigma_V$. The rotation moves H$_1$ to H$_2$ and H$_3$ to to H$_1$; reflection now exchanges the H$_3$ and H$_1$ atoms and the effect is the same as a $\\sigma_V'$ reflection: $C_3^+ \\otimes \\sigma_V = \\sigma_V'$. The reverse product is $\\sigma_V \\otimes C_3^+ = \\sigma_V''$ showing that these two operations do not commute; Figure 79.\n",

The vectors for the doubly degenerate mode,$2v_1 -v_2 -v_3$ and $-v_1 +2v_2 -v_3$ are calculated by taking vector 1 then 2 but the results are not orthogonal. To check this form, the dot product which is $[2 -1 -1] [-1 2 -1]^T = -3$. Using Sympy these can be made orthogonal, they do not need to be normalized to do this, but the 'True' in the GramSchmidt command normalises the vectors."
