A temporary, or dynamic equilibrium is set up as may be seen after B reaches a maximum because A and B decay at approximately the same rate to form C. C decays slowly, so its population passes through a maximum.\n",

The population does not decay to zero, because the fluorescence rate at $0.2\\cdot 10^9\\;\\mathrm{ s^{-1}}$ is about $1000$ times slower than the energy transfer rate, and on the short times range plotted the population appears to be constant. When we add quenching, which could be caused by energy-transfer to a second nearby FMO protein or to a reaction centre, the population now falls to zero in about $20$ ps as energy is drained out of the antenna.
