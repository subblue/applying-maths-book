    "A matrix can be of great use in solving simultaneous equations provided that its inverse exists. We consider two types of equations. First is the general case\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pmb{M}\\vec x =  \\vec C \\qquad\\tag{28} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\pmb M$ is a matrix and $\\vec x$ and $\\vec C$ are column vectors (one-dimensional matrices). Later on, we consider eigenvalue - eigenvector equations, which are more important and useful to us. In this section matrices are given bold letters, a vector is indicated by an arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of simultaneous equations can conventionally be written as shown below, but the matrix equation is equivalent and clearer.\n",

    "and the column vector of numbers is $\\vec C$ and $\\vec x$ the other column vector. To solve equation $29$, multiply the first equation by $2$, the second by $6$, and the third by $3$, then subtract to eliminate the $x$ and so on, until y and z are found. Clearly, this is a somewhat complicated business especially if there are, for example, ten equations and ten unknowns to solve for. At school, you may have used this method or Cramer's Rule, which is really a matrix method. This method has the following algorithm:\n",

    "In practice, you will generally want to use the computer to solve simultaneous equations and this is illustrated in two ways below using Python. In the matrix method, $\\vec C$ is a column matrix and $\\pmb{M}$ has rows of the equation coefficients. Some methods are shown below. The first two using numpy, which gives a numerical answer, the second using Sympy which gives the result algebraically but can be converted to real numbers by multiplying by $1.0$. When using numpy the $\\mathtt{linalg.inv(..)}$ produces the inverse of the matrix, the dot product $\\mathtt{np.dot(..,..)}$ performs the matrix multiplication. \n",

    "Consider mixing Martini which consists of various amounts of Gin and Vermouth. Different brands of Gin differ in their strength but typically it is about 40% alcohol by volume (abv) although Navy strength is $57$% abv! Vermouth is added ($19$% abv) in various proportions.  For the purposes of calculation we will assume that the Gin is $40$% V/V (volume/total aqueous volume) and Vermouth $19$% V/V. To make a classic Martini with a 3:1 ratio we look at the volume fraction $0\\le v \\le 1$ of the Gin and therefore for the Vermouth is $1-v$. The 3:1 Martini has the fraction of Gin as $f=3/(3+1)$ and so for Vermouth $1/4$. In this mixture the alcohol is present at $0.4f+0.19(1-f)= 0.4\\cdot 0.75+ 0.25\\cdot 0.19= 0.347$ or $34.7$%. In this example the only percentages available are clearly only in the range $19 \\to 40$%. In general if $v$ is the volume fraction ($0\\le f \\le 1$) and $\\vec a,\\;\\vec b$ vectors describing concentration of stock solutions then the combination is $f\\vec a+(1-f)\\bar b$, for example $\\vec b =\\begin{bmatrix} 0&19 \\end{bmatrix}$ for the Vermouth. \n",

This can be done for any composition on or inside the shaded triangle, i.e. along any of the vectors $\\vec a=\\overline{AB},\\;\\vec b=\\overline{BC},\\;\\vec c=\\overline{CA}$. If a composition outside this area is needed then a fourth standard/stock solution is needed, fig 53b.

This calculation shows how isotopic substitution makes it possible to calculate very accurate bond lengths even in large molecules; in fact, far more accurately than by X-ray crystallography.\n",

    "There does not initially appear to be enough information to do the calculation. However, the rotational constants are related to the moment of inertia of the molecule by $\\displaystyle B=\\frac{\\hbar}{4\\pi I}\\;\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ where $I$ is the moment of inertia (kg m$^2$). The moment of inertia is related to bond lengths as $I =\\Sigma_i m_i r_i^2$ where the sum is taken over all the distances $r$ the $i$ atoms have from the rotation axis. The mass of atom $i$ in kg is $m_i$. The rotational motion measured is perpendicular to the sixfold axis, which means that the rotation axis must pass through opposite carbon atoms, for instance, 1 and 4, Fig. 53. It is necessary to form two equations for the moments of inertia of the two molecules, and then to solve them simultaneously. Notice that the $B$ values are in wavenumbers, so it is necessary also to change $B$ to s$^{-1}$ by multiplying by the speed of light in cm s$^{-1}$. Moment of inertia calculations are described more fully in Section 15.6.\n",

The distance of each C atom from the axis, is either zero, which will not change the moment of inertia, or $h = r \\sin(60\\pi/180)$. Similarly, each H atom contributes either zero or $(r + s)\\sin(60\\pi/180)$. The moment of inertia is therefore due to four C and four H atoms,\n",

In contrast, operators, such as rotation matrices, or those used in group theory, would leave the vector $x$ unchanged in length but pointing in another direction.

When solving an eigenvalue - eigenvector equation, the values of all the eigenvectors and eigenvalues will be determined; for example in solving the Schroedinger equation, the Hamiltonian, the sum of kinetic and potential energy is defined by the problem at hand. Solving the equations produces not only the energy levels but also the wavefunctions.

We shall meet problems in quantum mechanics, chemical kinetics, and dynamics and although there are great differences, the language to describe various problems - that is the maths - follows the same path. In kinetics, eigenvalue equations are used when several _linear_ reactions have to be modelled. If there are five reactions, then a $5 \\times 5$ matrix of rate constants is constructed to describe the inter-conversion of species. In quantum mechanics, the Schroedinger equation is solved by expanding the new, and so far unknown, wavefunctions in a basis set of other wavefunctions. Interactions are added between various states and these are usually called *couplings*; mathematically they take the place of the rate constants used in kinetics. The _order_ of the _basis set_ determines where the couplings between states occur in the matrix. Reordering the basis set moves these positions about in the matrix, but does not affect the outcome. In kinetics, basis sets are usually not talked about; the order of the species occurring in a reaction scheme is, in effect, the basis set. Reorder the scheme, and the rate constants appear in different places in the matrix, but the result is unchanged.\n",

    "**(a)**$\\quad$ Any scalar multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector, because the operator $\\pmb A$ is linear; e.g. if an eigenvector is $x$ then $3x$ is also an eigenvector. If the operator $\\pmb A$ is raised to an integer power, $p = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\cdots$ then the eigenvalues are $\\lambda^p$. The eigenvectors are the same as those of $\\pmb A$.\n",

    "\n",
    "**(c)**$\\quad$ When the operator matrix $\\pmb A$ is Hermitian or symmetric, as in quantum mechanics problems, then the eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are more than linearly independent, they are _mutually orthogonal_ to one another. For example, if $x_a$ and $x_b$ are two eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues $a$ and $b$, they are orthogonal if $x_a·x_b = 0$. As the eigenvectors are orthogonal, the matrix $\\pmb A$ will be diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)**$\\quad$ In cases where eigenvectors are not orthogonal, there are strategies that can be used to achieve this if necessary; for example, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (Arkfen 1970).\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)**$\\quad$ To normalize an eigenvector $x_a$, as with any other vector, divide it by $\\sqrt{x_a·x_a}$. (Note that if the eigenvector is complex you must use $x_a^*\\cdot x_a$, where $*$ indicates the complex conjugate).\n",
    "\n",
    "**(f)**$\\quad$ Given eigenvectors $x_a$ and $x_b$ where $\\pmb{A}x_a = \\lambda_ax_a$ and $\\pmb{A}x_b = \\lambda_bx_b$, if $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are numbers (constants), then $\\pmb{A}(\\alpha x_a + \\beta x_b) = \\lambda (\\alpha x_a + \\beta  x_b)$.\n",

    "\n",

    "The nature of the secular determinant, and hence the matrix from which it is generated, needs explaining particularly in quantum mechanical problems. In these problems, the secular determinant is always symmetrical and contains only real numbers; it is Hermitian. The order of the element in both rows and columns is the same as the ordering of the basis set. If the secular determinant is diagonal, that is contains only the diagonal elements, and all the rest are zero, then the eigenvalues are the diagonal terms and are the solutions to the Schroedinger equation. If there are non-zero, off-diagonal terms, then these mix the basis set wavefunctions and energies together when the matrix is diagonalized. The off-diagonal terms are often referred to as coupling terms, because they 'cause interaction' between the energy levels in the diagonal of that row and column in which that matrix element is present. The type of interaction, Coulombic or dipole-dipole for instance, varies depending on the problem at hand. In the context of chemical kinetics the terms in the matrix are combinations of rate constants linking molecules of different types as described in by the rate equations, see section 13.\n",

The other curves (dashed) in this figure are the diabatic curves. The adiabatic wavefunction $\\psi$ is made up of various amounts of the diabatic wavefunctions $\\varphi$. However, in fig 54a (left A) these are the adiabatic curves as these arise from eqn. 34a and are the true solution to this Hamiltonian and do not cross.

    "We noted above that the symmetries of the two states interacting are important. If the symmetry is the same then the states interact and an avoided crossing occurs and a picture as in the right hand part of Fig(54a) results. If not, then no interaction is possible. Interactions causing the coupling $\\Delta$ are generated within the molecule and represent energy and therefore must be have a *totally symmetric* representation. This being the case because the probability of a transition in quantum mechanics between state 1 and 2 is proportional to  $\\displaystyle \\int \\psi_1\\Delta \\psi_2dr $ this integral will be zero unless $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ have the same symmetry. This may not be obvious, immediately, but first work out the integral say from $-r\\to r$ (the limits must be symmetrical) if both wavefunctions are either of the same symmetry and $\\Delta$ a constant or totally symmetric, and second if one wavefunction has 'odd' symmetry. In the latter case the integral is zero. The odd = even rules are $odd\\cdot  odd=even\\cdot even=even,\\; odd\\cdot even=0$. Examples are $\\int odd\\cdot even\\cdot odd \\ne 0$,$\\int even\\cdot even\\cdot even \\ne 0$, $\\int odd\\cdot even\\cdot even =0 $, see chapter 4, section 1.3.\n"

The wavepacket is the quantum equivalent of a particle, it is restricted in spacial extent as it is the sum of several wavefunctions each separated in energy. See chapter 5.9. As the wavepacket is confined in space and moves back and forth on $A_2$ this means that any population on $A_1$ will increase in a step-wise manner as there is a small chance that crossing the barrier $A_2\\to A_1$ occurs each time the wavepacket goes close to point $r_c$. This behaviour was first observed by Zewail and coworkers in NAI (Zewail 1994). This is examined shortly but first the factors determining the probability of reaction are described. \n",

This condition is met when the interaction energy is large making the energy gap between adiabatic curves $A_1$ and $A_2$ at the crossing point $r_c$ also large. This is the 'strong coupling' case and an example would be a ground state reaction crossing a potential barrier to product also on the ground state. The similar situation occurs when the difference in gradient between the two diabatic potentials is small making it easy to stay on the same adiabatic surface that to cross over to the other.  \n",

The product appears in stepwise manner because the total amount is monitored and a little more is added each time the crossing point is reached.
