    "**Q59 answer**  (a) The moment about the C$_4$ axis, which projects out of the plane of the molecule, is $I =4m_FR^2$ if $m_F$ is the mass of a fluorine atom and $R$ the bond length. Its value is $4\\times 18.9984\\times 1.6604\\cdot 10^{-27} \\times 4\\cdot 10^{-20} =5.047\\cdot10^{-45} \\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) The moment about a diagonal is $2m_FR^2$, because only two F atoms are not on the axis. The moment about the edge,involves calculating the perpendicular distance of the Xe and F atoms from the axis. Using Pythagoras' theorem, the Xe atom is $R/\\sqrt{2}$ from the axis and each F atom twice this. The moment is then $m_{Xe}R^2/2 + 2\\times 2m_FR^2$, which has a value $1.38\\cdot10^{-44}\\,\\mathrm{ kg\\,m^2}$ and is considerably larger than the other two moments because the heavy Xe atom is not on the rotation axis.\n",

    "**Q60 answer** (a)and(b) All the masses are at a fixed distance from the z-axis and the total mass of all particles is $M$, therefore, by definition $I_z = MR^2$ we can write down the answer directly. By the perpendicular axis theorem, $\\displaystyle I_x=\\frac{MR^2}{2}=I_y$. This value is smaller than about the z-axis because the mass is further from this axis than from either the $x$ or $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Inertia about the edge can be calculated by the parallel axis theorem, and should be that about the centre of mass of the z-axis plus $MR^2$, or $I = 2MR^2$. This is greater than $I_z$ because the mass is further from the axis on average, than is motion about the centre of the loop."
