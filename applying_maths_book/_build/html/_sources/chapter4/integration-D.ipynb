To do this, the probability distribution P of the quantity must be known.\n",

It has been implicitly assumed that each number is equally likely to have been measured, which is the familiar case because experiments are usually arranged in this way making them easier to do. It is not always true, however, that each value is equally probable, there is often a distribution of values that has to be taken into account, the Boltzmann distribution of energies or the degeneracy of rotational energy levels, for example.\n",

    "In quantum mechanics, if $\\psi$ are the normalized wavefunctions and $x$, for example, is the displacement of an atom in a vibrating diatomic molecule from its equilibrium value, then its average position is in state $k$ \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Expressions of this form are called the expectation value of the operator, which is $x$ in this case. The wavefunctions also depend on position $x$ although this is not explicitly shown. The subscript $k$ tells us that we are examining level $k$; the superscript * shows that this is the complex conjugate of the wavefunction. The $\\langle\\;\\rangle$  around the $x$ indicates an average value. Alternatively an average can be written with a bar as $\\bar x$. To the right of the equation the compact and much clearer bra-ket, or Dirac, notation is used, which uses only the indices of the wavefunction; see Chapter 8. Formally, in equation 37, $x$ is the _operator_ and it is always placed between the two wavefunctions. In this particular instance it does not make any difference where $x$ is, but if the operator was $d/dx$ then this has to be followed by something to operate on and this is always $\\psi$ and is preceded by $\\psi^*$ the complex conjugate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you are in the teaching lab and are asked to devise an experiment that attempts to measure $\\langle x\\rangle$ for a harmonic oscillator at several different vibrational energies. Do you rush away and collect lots of equipment or sit down and think about the problem? The former is definitely more exciting -select a laser, several mirrors and lenses, vacuum pump, oscilloscope, detectors, and so forth - but ultimately futile. Thinking about the experiment first is always the better option; it saves you wasting time on pointless experimentation, leaving you time to tackle interesting problems. The resulting average displacement $\\langle x\\rangle$, as you will have realized for a harmonic oscillator, should be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it concluded that the average displacement is zero just by looking at equation 37? Because the wavefunctions are the same, their product must be an *even function*; any normal function squared is an even function. Because any displacement such as $x$, is an odd function: $-x$ is not the same as $+x$, the integral is odd overall and must integrate to zero, provided the integration range is symmetrical about zero; Section 4.1.3. This result corresponds to the common sense observation that in the harmonic potential, the bond extension is equal and opposite to the compression, making the average displacement zero for any value of the vibrational quantum number. Figure 38 (in solutions) shows a harmonic potential. It was worth simply thinking about measuring the average displacement first. An experiment will still be needed, although we now know what to expect; it is often a mistake _not_ to do an experiment because you 'know' what the answer is. If the average displacement measured from different vibrational levels were different, what then might you conclude?\n",

    "The odd/even classification is very simple; space is split into two parts. If it were split into four parts then, as you can appreciate, things would be more complicated. In general where functions are more complex, as the molecular orbitals or the vibrational normal modes of molecules can be, then group theory (Chapter 7) must be used to decide whether or not the direct product of the irreducible representations are, or are not, non-totally symmetric.
