    "## 7.1 Introduction\n",
    "While the equations for a linear equation are manageable as summations, the polynomial equations become impossibly complicated. However, as the main concern is not in the algebraic form of the equations _per se_ , only in obtaining the solution to a problem, it is then simpler to convert the simultaneous normal equations into a matrix equation and to solve this for the constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting with the equation $y = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1x$ has already been described in some detail; the polynomial $y = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1x + \\alpha_2x^2$ and exponential $y = \\alpha_0e^{-\\alpha_1x}$ are also commonly found functions that describe data. The polynomial still belongs to the class of linear least squares because the normal equations can be solved exactly. The exponential equation will need a non-linear least squares method because the normal equations cannot be solved exactly and an iterative method is required. The method of choice is often the gradient expansion method, also called the Levenberg-Marquardt method, and this is discussed in Section 8. First, however, a matrix formulation of the linear least squares problem is presented and a solution obtained for a polynomial.\n",

    "## 8 Photon and particle counting and the Poisson distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is formed by accumulating many events, $n$, and describes the situation where each event has a very small probability of occurring, $p$, but the product $np$, the mean number of events, is moderate. The distribution is asymmetric and skewed towards small numbers, Figure 13, because it is not possible to have a negative number of events. This distribution is observed when photons are counted or particles counted after a radioactive atom disintegrates, provided their decay time is long compared to the observation time. However, the distribution applies to many other types of events, such as the number of faulty CDs produced, the number of misprints on a printed page, or the number of students absent from a class in any week. One of the earliest examples was recorded over a twenty year period during the 1800's, and was the number of deaths of infantrymen in the Prussian army after they were kicked by a horse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a sample of molecules is continuously excited, and their fluorescence viewed through a small aperture or through filters to reduce the intensity so that photons are detected one at a time by a photodiode or photomultiplier. The number of electrical pulses from the detector for, say, $1000$ time intervals each of $1$ second duration is recorded. If a histogram of the number of events recorded in each time interval is made, then this should follow a Poisson distribution. If DNA is exposed to UV light, photo-damage can occur by base pairs forming dimers. If the DNA is spliced into pieces of equal length, the number of dimers in each piece can be recorded. If the pieces are each very small, 10 base pairs for example, most will not contain a dimer, a few will contain one and fewer still will contain two or more and so on. The distribution formed will have a large value for zero dimers and become smaller as the number of dimers increases. In a second experiment, suppose that $100$ base pair long segments are examined. Now only a few segments have no dimer, some have one and many have two, three, or four but fewer segments will have five or more. This distribution is now peaked at a value of, say, $2.5$. Repeating the experiment with a larger segment will cause the distribution to peak at still larger values until it closely resembles a normal distribution. What has changed between the experiments is only the average number of dimers detected in each segment, thus the Poisson distribution is determined by only one parameter, the average number of 'events'. A similar argument applies to the number of photons or particles detected in progressively longer time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution applies when the number of events $n$ that are measured is very large, but the chance $p$ of any one event occurring is very small. The product $\\mu = np$ is the mean or average number of events and is of moderate value. The distribution can be derived from first principles, see Hines & Montgomery (1990, chapter 6.8) for this proof, or it can be obtained from the binomial distribution when $n$ is large and $p$ small. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Poisson process is that one that generates the distribution and assumes that each event randomly occurring is independent of all others and that each occurs in a non-overlapping time interval (i.e. its own).

    "Photon and particle counting experiments normally follow a Poisson distribution. The weighting to use is $w_i = 1/c_i$ where $c_i$ is the mean number of counts at the $i^{th}$ data point in the data, thus, the weighting is always known. This does lead to a specific problem, viz., what happens when no counts are recorded in a particular channel, $c_i = 0$? This is quite possible at low light levels as occurs in single photon counting fluorescence decay experiments, or, when measuring fluorescence from single molecules through a confocal microscope. The advice to deal with this is to manipulate the data either by ignoring values below $10$ counts, or to add $1$ to every data point or to make each zero into $1$ and leave all the rest alone. None of this is satisfactory because it will cause incorrect parameters to be produced to the fitted data, and must be avoided. By making these changes, both the data and residuals are changed similarly so the effect can be disguised. The solution (Turton et al. Anal. Chem. 2003) is to fit the data with a weighting of $1$ and then the use values from the fitted curve as the weighting and refit the data. This has been shown to produce unbiased fits down to a very few counts in the total signal and contradicts the widespread assumption that least squares fitting of Poisson distributed data is invalid. One further point worth making is that when conducting counting experiments, it is not the maximum number of counts in any one channel that is important for data fitting but the total number of counts in the whole signal."

    "## 9 Estimating signals buried in noise\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful feature of Poisson distributed data is that their sum is also Poisson distributed. If $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\cdots$ are a set of Poisson distributed random numbers with means $\\mu_1, \\mu_2\\cdots$, then their sum $\\mu = \\mu_1 + \\mu_2 + \\mu_2 + \\cdots$ is also Poisson distributed with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sqrt{\\mu}$. Thus, data can be summed to improve its standard deviation. However, Poisson distributed data cannot be subtracted, because it would be quite possible to obtain negative numbers. This means that when a signal that is Poisson distributed has some background noise, this cannot be subtracted away but the model used to analyse the data has to contain a constant term to account for this, if the background is known to be constant, or a polynomial if it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "All instruments produce noise unrelated to the signal and it is often necessary to decide if a signal is present in noise but summing (binning) data does not help because the noise is also summed. For example, a very weak light source may be obscured by thermally induced 'dark' noise from the detector (photomultiplier, photodiode, or CCD etc.) and subsequently amplified in other circuitry. Alternatively, the noise could be from other light close in wavelength to the one being detected or electrical noise added by amplifiers. To decide if a signal is present, data has to be taken with and without what is suspected to be the true signal being there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing between signal and noise depends crucially only on their respective standard deviations. A large and constant background is not a problem; it is the _fluctuation_ in the background that limits the signal to noise. To illustrate this, an argument presented by Parratt (1971, Chapter 5.8) based on the combination of errors equation, is described. If there are two sets of counts, $c_b$ for the background and $c_{sb}$ for signal and background, because a signal cannot be detected without background, then the difference in the population _means_ is\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle \\mu_s-\\mu_{sb}=c_b-c_{sb}\\pm \\Delta s$$\n",

For single measurements of Poisson data the standard deviation is equal to the number of counts giving $\\Delta s=\\sqrt{2\\left(c_b^2+c_{sb}^2\\right)}$. If the two means $\\mu_b$ and $\\mu_{sb}$ are for the moment assumed to be the same then $c_b - c_{sb}$ can be tested by comparing with $\\Delta s$ at, say, the $5$% probability level of a standard normal distribution to determine the chance whether or not $c_b = c_{sb}$. If the ratio $| c_b - c_{sb} |/\\Delta s = 1$, then the probability that $c_b \\ne c_{sb} = 0.32$, (or $32$%) which is the area of the normal curve _above_ $x/\\sigma = 1$, Figure 4 and this is too small to be considered very strong proof that the signal and noise are different. If the ratio $| c_b - c_{sb} |/\\Delta s \\ge 1.96$ then chance that $c_b \\ne c_{sb}$ is measured at the $95$ % level (see Table 1) and the signal would be distinguishable from background.\n",

Using the cumulative distribution described in equation 9, the chance that $c_b \\ne c_{sb}$ is $\\approx 27$%. Note that to use the two sided values the integration is multiplied by 2 and subtracting one makes it the chance $c_b \\ne c_{sb}$."
