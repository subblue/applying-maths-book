    "\n",
    "In the least squares method, the derivative of the $\\chi^2$ is taken with respect to each parameter $\\alpha_i$ and minimized. The normal equations of linear least squares analysis (equations 28,44), have terms only in $a_ix$ or $a_ix^2$ etc., and can be solved exactly. In non-linear least squares, the normal equations cannot be solved exactly. The function \n",

    "has a form that is common to several schemes in chemical kinetics and when analysing the decay of excited states, but in this function the normal equations still contain exponentials in $\\alpha_i$ and $x$, for example $e^{-\\alpha_2x}$ and cannot be solved exactly. An approximate numerical solution has to be sought, usually by an iterative method. Any iterative method follows an algorithm that tries to approach the minimum $\\chi^2$ without searching through the whole range of possible values of the parameters ($\\alpha$'s). There are several algorithms to choose from, some, such as the simplex, simulated annealing (Prest et al. 1986), and evolutionary (natural selection) algorithms are not least squares methods; however, the best algorithm for non-linear least squares is the Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm (Bevington 1969; Prest et al. 1986; Bevington & Robinson 2003). Importantly, it is easy to implement and operates stably, i.e. it hardly ever fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a numerical method implies \n",
    "\n",
    "**(i)**$\\quad$ that starting values have to be defined for each of the parameters sought,\n",
    "\n",
    "**(ii)**$\\quad$  increments in these have to be determined and are changed as the calculation proceeds, \n",
    "\n",
    "**(iii)**$\\quad$  some ending condition has been specified for an acceptable fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These requirements mean that this problem is far harder to solve than is linear least-squares, partly for the reasons given, but also because there is no guarantee that the true minimum will be found even if the calculation appears to end satisfactorily. This last effect has two forms. The first is that close to the minimum solution several related sets of parameters can satisfy the same goodness of fit criterion, so that a unique set is not found, only a range of them. The second effect is that the 'surface' through and about which the minimum $\\chi^2$ is sought may be rough, with local minima in which the calculation can become trapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\chi^2$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\chi^2=\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(y_i-Y_i(\\alpha_j))^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the subscript $i$ identifies the data points and $j$ the parameters, $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\cdots$. The $\\chi^2$ surface would ideally be shaped rather like a bowl so that it can be imagined how starting at one point the minimum can be reached. But it is instead highly complex, and can be represented as a three-dimensional object only if two parameters are used and if there are more, and there usually are, it is almost impossible to have an idea what this object may look like. In the best circumstance, the object is smooth and a minimum is found, but generally, it might be supposed that the objects 'landscape' is 'corrugated' with many local minima separated by 'hills' and 'ridges'. However, not withstanding the complexity of the $\\chi^2$ 'surface', most equations describing physical and chemical phenomena can be success- fully minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite often, finding the true minimum starts with initial guesses for the parameters close to the final ones that the calculation will produce. Often, approximate parameters can be guessed by looking at the data; they do not usually have to be that good for the calculation to converge perhaps within a factor of 5 or 10. Alternatively, the literature can be consulted to find values for similar experiments. If this is not possible, as there may be too many variables to find them all, then ranges must be placed on these and perhaps hundreds of sets of parameters can be guessed at random and those with the smallest $\\chi^2$ chosen as starting points. Once the calculation is run, if the results are not particularly good it may be because (a) the function is sensitive to the starting values; (b) it ended up in a local not the global minimum; (c) the calculation did not run long enough to converge; or, if it did converge, (d) the model did not describe the data. Starting the calculation with different initial conditions will usually help to sort this out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Levenberg - Marquardt Method combines two different approaches to finding the minimum $\\chi^2$; Bevington (1969) and Prest et al. (1986) give detailed derivations and equations. The first approach is a gradient-search method that tries to find the steepest descent from any point towards the minimum of the surface that represents the $\\chi^2$. This method is good when the calculation is a long way from the minimum, as it allows it to be approached rapidly because the gradient is large. When close to the minimum, this method is poor because the gradient may be almost zero and the calculation will creep along, hardly making any progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient in the $\\chi^2$ is calculated as $\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n\\frac{\\partial \\chi^2}{\\partial \\alpha_j}$. The second aspect to the method is to change the equations close to the minimum where the model function $Y$ can be accurately expanded as a Taylor series in the parameters $\\alpha_i$ and the $\\chi^2$ is minimized, and normal equations calculated. It turns out, fortunately, that the two sets of equations, steepest descent and expansion, can be changed into one another by varying only one parameter conventionally called $\\lambda$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\boldsymbol C=\\boldsymbol{BA}^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the linear case, these equations can be solved by inverting matrix $A$ and left multiplying by matrix $B$ as is done in Algorithm 3. The equations in the non-linear case are formally the same as those of equation 48 but now the solution must be obtained iteratively. The iterative part has nothing to do with the Marquardt method; this method changes only the diagonals of matrix $A$ and so moves from a gradient search to a linear expansion of the function.

The total number of counts in the data is $5925$, which is rather a small number for an experiment, although single molecule fluorescence measured through a confocal microscope may have far fewer than this.

    "\n",
    "In the life sciences, the experimental techniques of chemical physics, for instance, NMR, FTIR, mass spectrometry, and various chromatographic methods are widely used and they produce large quantities of data. The data may consist of hundreds of data sets each containing data from thousands of proteins and metabolites and from which the presence of a few target molecules may be sought. For example, NMR spectra taken on blood plasma will contain signals from thousands of compounds. If samples are taken from a group of patients with a particular disease and a similar group without the disease, the two sets of NMRs can be compared in an attempt to identify markers that may be used to target the disease, either in an attempt either to cure it, or act as an assay to identify its early stages. However, these spectra will be different due to normal variability, will be highly congested and contain numerous overlapping signals from proteins, lipids, sugars, and DNA not involved in the disease. The task is to find the species that are either present or are missing in the diseased group. The problem is that there is an abundance of data but no results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from any instrument is not always in the form that most easily allows the results required to be extracted from it. PCA attempts to rotate the axes with which the data is presented in such a way as to isolate each of its features independently of all of the others. This method produces new variables that are linear combinations of the original data and these are the principal components; mathematically a new orthogonal basis set is produced with which to represent the data (Jolliffe 2002; Miller & Miller 2005). Recall that in changing a basis, the data (a vector) is unaffected only the axes are changed. Some of these new components may contain only background or noise while others contain the data. Sorting out which ones to keep requires some judgement; the process is not automatic. The PCA method is therefore a way of reducing the size of a data set, the penalty is that some data is lost; however, this may not be significant, simply necessary to expose the pertinent data. This type of analysis is therefore always a balance between simplifying the problem to make it understandable and loosing information. Note that principal component analysis is a non-parametric method of analysing data; correlations are sought between data sets without using any model to describe the data. In contrast, the least squares method is a _parametric_ method because a model (equation) is used to test the data.\n",

This distinction is illustrated in figure 16 where any data point has approximately equal values of coefficients $a$, because it is approximately equally positioned between the three experimental x-axes whereas those on the new axes $p$, have a large initial value $b_1$, along $p_1$ and smaller ones along $p_2$ and $p_3$. \n",

    "PCA changes the basis set to optimize the variance placing the principal axis along the direction of maximum spread or variance of the data, and other principal components orthogonally to this. Figure 16 also shows the new axes $p$ as the principal component axes, two of which are shown on the right and where two regions of data are identified. The missing data in this graph compared to the one on the left is in the direction $p_3$ and not $p_2$, and would be seen on a plot of $p_1$ vs $p_3$ and in this way, the change of axes (basis set) can identify different groups of data. The next step in PCA is to reduce the size of the basis set used; this means describing the data in the basis set $u$ with a smaller set of terms in the summation; $s$ instead of $n$. Because the change of axes puts more contributions of each data point along each principal axis, fewer terms are now needed to form an acceptable description of the data, although all the basis set is needed to reproduce the data exactly. A reduced data set is often the rationale for using PCA, with the aim of identifying new signals, removing noise and/or isolating known interfering signals.\n",

    "Related to PCA is the method of singular value decomposition (SVD). Formally, it is a technique in which one matrix is split into three, one of them is diagonal and the other two are row and column orthogonal as are eigenvector modal matrices (Prest et al. 1986). The reason for expanding a matrix in this way is that it can now be inverted even though it is close to being singular, i.e. inverting it would normally produce infinity or a number that approximates this, and normal inversion methods fail. This method could be used to invert the $A$ matrix in non-linear least squares, in the example given. The interest in SVD is however not primarily to do with the mathematics but in un-ravelling complex information just as in PCA. SVD can be used either directly on raw data, not the covariance as in PCA, or as a mathematical method to perform PCA (Jolliffe 2002)."
