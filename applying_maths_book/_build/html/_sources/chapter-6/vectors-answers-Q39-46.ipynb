Their dot product is $\\vec v_2\\cdot\\vec v_3 = (+1 +0 +0 +1 +0 +0) = 2$ so these vectors are not orthogonal to one another. Orbitals 5 and 6 are orthogonal with orbitals 1 to 4, but not with one another because their dot product produces $-2$ and not zero.\n",

    "and because it is negative, this means that the interaction is attractive.

    "\n",
    "(b) The minimum interaction occurs when the two terms n the equation are of equal and opposite sign, or both are zero. Intuitively, the latter occurs when the two dipoles are at $90^\\text{o}$ to one another as shown below, figure 71, and therefore, the positive and negative interactions cancel. However, the interaction is only zero if the one dipole points towards the centre of the other as in the left-hand diagram.\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, zero interaction can occur when the two terms in the equation cancel. If we assume that the dipoles are in the plane of the page, then by making a triangle of the two vectors, as shown in figure 26, the angle between the dipoles is $\\gamma = 180 - \\alpha - (180 - \\beta)$.

    "Figure 72 shows the solution by plotting $\\tan(\\alpha)$ and $2/\\tan(\\beta)$ vs the angle which produces $\\alpha=\\beta= \\pm 54.73^\\text{o}$, therefore both dipoles are parallel and at the same angle to the vector separating them, as shown below.\n",

Thermal energy at 300 K is $4.142 \\cdot 10^{-21} \\equiv 414.2 \\cdot 10^{-23}$ J, which is larger by $\\approx 10^4$ times than the dipole - dipole interaction. Therefore, at this temperature the dipolar molecules cannot take up any preferred orientations with respect to one another because solvent molecules continuously jostle them and this has the effect of randomising their orientations."

    "(a) The interaction between the dipoles is estimated by considering the distance between their positive and negative partial charges. The separation between the C and O atoms is constant, therefore so is their interaction, each atom's dipole here being slightly $\\delta+$. The determining attraction is therefore between the negative ends of each dipole with the positive and negative parts of the other dipole.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the molecule shown on the left of figure 74, the negative charges of the two dipoles are far apart between the two axial positions, so interact only slightly. The interaction between the axial $\\vec\\mu_x$ and equatorial $\\vec\\mu_O$ is larger, as the ends of the dipole are closer, and is more repulsive than the $a-a$ interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The molecule on the right with the $e$ substituent, has a strong repulsive interaction between the $e-e$ direction dipoles and the same repulsion for the $e-a$ interaction as in the other molecule, therefore, the $e$ substituent molecule is less stable. In a solvent all the interactions are reduced by $1/\\epsilon$ which is largest in a polar solvent. If the dipole interaction is already small, making it smaller has little effect. Therefore, the solvent effect is most important in reducing the $e$ substituent's dipole repulsion, making it more likely that equal amounts of the axial and equatorial substituents are produced in polar solvents, as shown by experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Determining the geometry of the molecule is the most difficult part, whereas calculating the dot products is relatively easy so the calculation is far easier using vectors. Using the idealized symmetry of the structure considerably simplifies the calculation; bonds $A$ and $A'$ are parallel to one another, and so are the $B$ and $B'$, and $C$ and $C'$ bonds; the projection of bond $B$ bisects the $C'-A'$ bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, that a tetrahedral atom can be placed at the centre of a cube the surrounding atoms reaching opposite corners, see question 14. This enables us to determine the molecule's coordinates as shown in the diagram, and from these, bond vectors can be made with which to calculate the dipole energy.\n",

    "(a) The Mg-Mg distance is calculated using positional vectors,say $p$ and $q$, from the origin, $\\vec OO=\\begin{bmatrix} 0& 0& 0\\end{bmatrix}$ to each of the Mg atoms. The distance is then $|\\vec p -\\vec q|$.\n",

When normalised this Mg-Mg vector is $\\begin{bmatrix}0.677 &-0.608 &-0.415\\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
