    "### Q1 Orientation\n",
    "You go mountain biking from home and travel due north along a track for $2$ km then north-east for another $3$ km.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Represent your journey graphically, and work out how far and in what direction you are from home as the crow flies. You may find it useful to use the cosine formula, $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(\\alpha)$ and the law of sines, $ab \\sin(\\alpha) = bc \\sin(\\beta) = ac \\sin(\\chi)$. ($\\alpha$ is the angle opposite $a,\\; \\beta$ opposite $b$ etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Work out the result using Python to do the arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Repeat the calculation in matrix form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Sketch the diagram, define the angles, and add the information given in the question. The diagram need not be exact but if it is then you can measure the angles and lengths to confirm your calculations. The vectors are calculated from their coordinates projected on to each axis.\n",

    "### Q2 Many forces\n",
    "Six forces $f_1\\cdots f_6$, act simultaneously on a body. What force must be applied to prevent the body from moving?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** If a body does not move, then the resultant of all forces acting on it must be zero. The resultant force must be the equal and opposite of the six applied forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3 Orientation\n",
    "On a windless day, an aeroplane travels at $200$ mph to its destination $R$ in a north-westerly direction. On another day, the wind is blowing from the west at $50$ mph. In what direction and how fast should the plane now fly to reach its destination?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Draw out the vector diagram and sum the vectors. Let O be the origin. The plane travels along the line OR over the ground with its nose pointing somewhat into the wind. To compensate for the wind, the plane thus points vectorially along the course OP which has a larger angle from the north and so is to the west of O.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Cosine formula\n",
    "Using the triangle in  figure 6, prove the cosine formula $c^2 =a^2 +b^2 -2ab\\cos(\\chi)$, where $a,b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the vectors $\\vec A, \\vec B$, and $\\vec C$ respectively.\n",

    "Use vectors to show that the internal angle of a triangle ($\\angle $ ACB), figure 7, whose hypotenuse is the diameter of a semicircle, is $90^\\text{o}$. The equation of a circle centred at the origin is $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Let the triangle be ABC. If the angle ACB is a right angle, then the dot product of vector AC and CB is zero; it is necessary, therefore, to find these vectors with the restriction that C always lies on the circumference of the circle. Define the origin of the coordinates as the centre of the circle; O then OC, OA, OB are radii of length $r$. Use two-dimensional vectors in the basis set $\\boldsymbol i$ and $\\boldsymbol j$ or in matrix - vector form. Find $\\vec{CA}\\cdot \\vec{CB}$, it is zero if they are at $90^\\text{o}$.\n",

    "Use vectors to prove that that the angle at the centre of the circle $\\varphi$, (see Q5) is twice that at the circumference $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Calculate both $\\varphi$ and $\\theta$ using dot products, then use the identity $\\cos(2\\alpha) = 2 \\cos^2(\\alpha) - 1$, that is true for any angle $\\alpha$, to prove that $\\varphi = 2\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Perpendicular vectors\n",
    "(a) For what value of $a$ is $A=a\\boldsymbol i+2\\boldsymbol j-\\boldsymbol k$ perpendicular to $B=3a\\boldsymbol i+a\\boldsymbol j+11\\boldsymbol k$? \n",

    "### Q8 Angles in triangle\n",
    "The sides of a triangle, figure 8 are given by $A = [3\\; 2\\; -1]$ and $B = [3\\; -5\\; 6]$. Determine its angles. This shows how easy a calculation is when basis sets are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Find the vector of the third side and calculate two dot products; the third angle can be determined because the sum of the internal angles is $180^\\text{o}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9 Angle between vectors\n",

    "### Q11 Dot product\n",
    "A straight line joins point $(2, 3, -6)$ with $(3, -2, 4)$; find the acute angles this line makes with the axes. The cosines of these angles are called direction cosines, and they are the dot product of the vector with each axis considered to be a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** The points are made into a vector defined as the difference of one from another. Let the $x-, y-$, and $z$-axes have unit vectors pointing along them, for example $x = [1\\; 0\\; 0]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q12 Diagonals in a cube\n",
    "Find the acute angle $\\theta$ between the two diagonals of a cube. Show that the obtuse angle is $109.47^\\text{o}$, which is that for tetrahedral sp$^3$ hybrid orbitals and found in saturated hydrocarbons.\n",

    "Figure 10 shows part of the backbone of a carbon polymer chain drawn within two cubes, and with each bond of length $d$. Calculate the angles $\\theta, \\phi$, and $\\chi$ the angle to the $y$-axis, and the bond angle $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Define the sides and diagonals as three-dimensional vectors. Choose $O$ as the origin to begin with. The basis set is that of three orthogonal vectors along the $x-, y-$, and $z$-axes. To calculate $\\alpha$ move this carbon atom to the origin and recalculate vectors $\\vec{go}$ and $\\vec{gf}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "(b) Calculate the exact bond angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** The C atom should be placed at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$, then the H atoms can be placed at the corners of a cube of side $2a$. (Choosing the length of a side to be $2a$ makes the arithmetic easier.) Using the information given, work out the other coordinates of the H atoms and use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate distances. Use dot products to calculate angles.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** (a) The bond lengths and angles are calculated as in the previous problem. Because the molecule has threefold symmetry, the height that the N atom is above the plane of the H atoms, is calculated by finding the midpoint of the plane, making a vector to this point from the N atom, and calculating the distance.\n",

    "NaCl normally grows as a cubic crystal but crystals of the shape of a truncated cube, figure 12, are formed as the 'habit' if NaCl crystals are grown in the presence of urea. Triangular pyramidal shapes are missing from the cube; the remaining shapes and similar ones when corners or edges are missing, are called _coigns_ , and can sometimes be seen on the sides of old houses. Vertex $A$ is at a distance $1$ from the centre, so that a sphere of unit radius touches each point equivalent to $A$.\n",

One possible geometry is shown in figure 13; the lines representing the diffracted X-rays are the limits of a cone of diffracted rays whose axis is the line of atoms, as shown on the right.\n",

The planes generating a diffraction spot are those that intersect with the sphere. Any lattice point with a negative index is shown with a line above the number.
