From this result $\\cos(\\theta) = -1/3$, making the angle $109.47^\\text{o}$.\n",

    "### Q28 answer\n",
    "In this example, the s-orbital $\\psi_s$ is spherically symmetric and cannot affect in which direction the hybrid orbitals point and we need not include it in the calculation. Comparing the orbital coefficients $b=-1/\\sqrt{6},\\quad c=\\sqrt{3}/\\sqrt{ 6}=1/\\sqrt{2};\\quad d=0$ because there is no $\\psi_{p_z}$ wavefunction included in $\\psi_1$, and for $\\psi_2$, $b=-1/\\sqrt{6},\\quad c=-1/\\sqrt{2};\\quad d=0$.\n",

    "and the $s$ orbital is ignored. The angle between them is found from the dot product $\\vec v_1\\cdot \\vec v_2 = |\\vec v_1 ||\\vec v_2 |\\cos(\\theta)$ and using equation 2, $\\cos(\\theta)=-1/2$ or $\\theta =120^\\text{o}$ so it seems reasonable that $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ represent sp$^2$ hybrid orbitals. If we did include the $s$ orbitals in a basis set of four elements, the $s$ and three $p$ orbitals, then these vectors are orthogonal which they have to be for any eigenfunctions that are solution of the Schroedinger equation,\n",

    "therefore, these orbitals are orthogonal. To calculate the angle, the $s$ orbital part has to be ignored and the calculation repeated, remembering to re-normalize the vector, as it is now only two dimensional.
