    "(a) The fluorescence lifetime is $\\tau = 1/(1 \\cdot 10^7 + 2 \\cdot 10^8) =4.76$ ns. The yield is $\\varphi =k_f/(k_f +k_{isc})=k_f\\tau =0.0476$, which is very small. The triplet state rises at the same rate as the singlet decays, i.e. in $1/(4.76$ ns), not at the rate given by the intersystem crossing rate constant $2 \\cdot 10^8\\,\\mathrm{ s^{-1}}$. It is important to appreciate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Algorithm 5 needs slight modification. The rate constants are different and the timescale needs to be changed to $100$ ns, which is a guess, and may need to be changed later on. Because there are two reacting species, the excited state and the triplet, a check has to be made to make sure that the numbers in any of the states do not go below zero. Try the simulation with A0 = $1000$ initial molecules in nA and increase these numbers as necessary. Eventually, the number of triplet states becomes zero and the calculation must end when this occurs because there are no more molecules left to react. At this point, the number in the ground state is equal to the initial number, and this is checked for in the 'while nG $\\lt$ A0 do:' step at the beginning of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of triplet states increase when populated from the singlet, and decrease when the ground state is reformed. Checks are needed to decide which reaction occurs, there are three, from the excited state to the ground state, to the triplet and from the triplet to the ground state adjusting the number of molecules each time as required. This involves several steps in the algorithm below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $a_0$, equation 8, is the sum $a_0 =k_fn_A+k_{isc}n_A+k_Tn_T$. The rate constants must be put into a ns scale which means dividing $k_k,\\; k_{isc}$ by $10^9$.  \n",

There are always two decisions to make; one calculates the time and the other which reaction will occur based on $\\mathtt{phif}$. At long times when the state T is full, the yield $\\varphi$ becomes unity because the state A can only convert to state G. If $k_f$ is the fluorescence rate constant, then $\\varphi$ is the fluorescence yield, which is the same as the yield for ground state formation. The calculation should continue as long as nA does not become zero, and to ensure this, make its initial value equal to the number of events.

    "The following modification to the Gillespie algorithm could be used. The whole calculation will need to be repeated, say, 100 times and the results averaged. This is because of the small number of individuals who could catch the disease and hence only a small number of trials are possible. \n",

The infected numbers rise and then fall; those susceptible to infection fall as they become infected and then immune, and enter the R or removed group."
