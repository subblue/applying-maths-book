# Introduction

This book is a much updated and corrected version of 'Applying Maths in the Chemical and Biomolecular Sciences, an example based approach' published by OUP 2009. The code and examples are now all in Python 3 and using numpy, scipy and sympy as  necessary for calculations and matplotlib for graphics. The updated text was written using Jupyter notebooks. All these packages are free to use, a quite remarkable gift to anyone interested in science, engineering and mathematics. The code for many calculations is included in the text and can be copied and used diectly into a notebook mostly with only minor changes. The code is written in a simple form, not necessarily the most efficient, and is aimed at gaining an undersatanding of the calculation.

More examples have been added to most chapters, for example in chemical kinetics and some new topics added such as fourier methods to solve differential equations, x-ray diffraction and computed tomography. The fully worked out solutions to the problems are included at the end of each chapter.

## Preface to original edition

This textbook is primarily intended for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students, although the more elementary parts of the subject are included so as to make the book complete in itself. It is not written with any particular science degree in mind although the emphasis is towards the chemistry and physics of molecules with examples ranging from hydrogen to proteins and DNA.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the late Dr. David Salt for reading and critically commenting on early drafts of several chapters, David Fogarty for the experimental data used in Chapter 13,  Marcelo de Miranda, Gavin Reid and Briony Yorke for their constructive comments on numerous topics, and to Tom Beddard for help with compiling this web book. I also thank the authors of the books and papers which have formed the basis of several questions and diagrams all of whom I have tried to acknowledge in the text. Finally I thank my family who have received much less of my time and attention than is their due and to whom this work is dedicated.
