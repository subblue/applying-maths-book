It is not at all obvious why this connection exists from an arithmetical standpoint, but from a geometrical one it is clearer.

    "### 4.2 Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's formula is important in science, because it permits the description of a sinusoidally varying real quantity by means of complex exponentials as in Fourier Transforms described in Chapter 9. This change simplifies equations, because it is far easier to manipulate exponentials than trig functions. For example, the general form of a sinusoidally varying quantity, such as a plane wave, is $f (t) = a_0\\cos(\\omega t - \\theta)$, where $a_0$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ the frequency, and $\\theta$ the phase. These are all constants, and $t$ is time and is a real variable. The equivalent complex function is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle g(t) = a_0e^{i(\\theta-\\omega t)} = a_0\\left(\\cos(\\omega t - \\theta) - i \\sin(\\omega t - \\theta)\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "therefore $f(t) = Re(g(t))$. Very often in chemistry and physics, the complex form is used without explicitly stating that it is only the real part that represents the waveform. Figure 7 compares these waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of using Euler's equation, we will evaluate $w = \\ln(-1)$ even though it doesn't exist as a pure real number, then calculate $w = \\ln(i)$ and $w = \\ln(z/3)$, where $z$ is any complex number. The strategy in problems of this type is to convert the number $-1$, or $i$, or whatever it is into an exponential form using Euler's theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i)** In the first example, $w = \\ln(-1)$ or $e^w = -1$ and $w$ has to be found to solve this equation. A general complex number can always be written as $z = re^{i\\theta}$, therefore to find $w$, let $w = i\\theta$. The absolute value (modulus) $r$ of $e^w$ is $e^{i\\theta}e^{-i\\theta} = 1$. Because $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i \\sin(\\theta)$, when $\\theta = \\pi$, $e^{i\\theta} = -1$ making the principal value of $\\ln(-1) = \\ln(1e^{i\\pi}) = i\\pi$, which, obviously, is a complex number. Note that there are other values of $\\theta$ separated by $2k\\pi i$, where $k$ is an integer because $e^{i\\theta}$ is a cyclic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(ii)** Suppose $w=\\ln(i)$ or $e^w =i$. Let $w=i\\theta$. As $e^{i\\theta} =\\cos(\\theta)+i\\sin(\\theta)$,when $\\theta = \\pi/2$ this equation produces $e^{i\\pi/2} = i$ or $\\ln(i) = i\\pi/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(iii)** If $w = \\ln(z/3)$, then $3e^w = z$, and if $z$ is any complex number then we look for a value of $\\theta$ such that $3e^{i\\theta} = z$. Generally a complex number is represented by $z = re^{i\\theta}$, then in this example $w = \\ln(z) = \\ln(3e^{i\\theta}) = \\ln(3) + i(\\theta + 2\\pi k)$ and $2\\pi k$ is added because the function is cyclic and $k$ is any integer; recall that the Euler equation can be put into a cosine and sine form, so it is a repetitive function. The principal value occurs when $k = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to example (i), $w = \\ln(-1)$, if the $-1$ is treated as a complex number with an imaginary part that is zero, then the answer can be written down directly as $w = \\ln(-1) = \\ln(re^{i\\theta}) = \\ln(1) + i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)$\n",
    "and, since $r = 1$ and $\\ln(1) = 0$, this gives the same result as in (i) $\\ln(-1) = i\\pi$ for the principal value.\n",
