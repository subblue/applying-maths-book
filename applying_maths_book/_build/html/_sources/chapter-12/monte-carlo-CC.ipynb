    "## 3.1 Concept and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In numerically integrating differential and other equations, a number of methods are available. Some Monte Carlo methods are described in earlier sections and other methods are described in Chapter 11. In this section simulations are described. A simulation uses the underlying physical laws and principles to control the calculation; no differential equations will be used. Usually processes, such as the decay of an excited state, the dispersal of a population of animals, or diffusion of molecules, can be simulated by taking a stochastic approach to the problem, repeating many calculations and slowly building up the results. This approach may seem rather odd; why not just solve the equations and be done with it? Well, sometimes this approach is simply pragmatic; a Monte Carlo approach is sometimes simpler and quicker to use. More often, it is the case that the equations describing some complex phenomenon cannot be solved algebraically or are simply not known because the process being studied is too complex. In these cases, we turn to the underlying physical laws and principles to control a simulation. Other examples of problems that can be studied are reaction kinetics, nuclear spins interacting with one another in a solid, ions moving through membrane pores, animals or people infecting one another, the spreading of forest fires, and oil moving through pores in rocks and so forth. Any computer simulation should be repeated many times to obtain an average value and then repeated again with many different initial values to explore the problem properly and to learn what are the important parameters that control behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two classes of Monte Carlo calculations must be clearly distinguished. The class described in the last section uses a Monte Carlo method to solve rate equations or, in general, differential equations. The method now described is to *simulate* a physical process from first principles without explicitly solving equations. The algorithms to do these two types of calculations are, in many cases, rather similar, but the way they operate is fundamentally different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Simulating physical processes\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a very general approach, and in principle applies to almost any process, there are no fixed rules other than to understand the problem at a fundamental level and then decide how it can be broken down into individual steps. Random numbers are always used to decide what is going to happen next, and the result of many trial calculations summed to remove any bias set up by the random nature of the process. It is important to bear in mind that we do not try to simulate any actual physical process but rather use a sort of pseudo-dynamics to reach the result by taking one atom or molecule at a time and deciding what it might end up doing, and then repeating this numerous times until we are satisfied with the result according to some predetermined condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider simulating one-dimensional molecular diffusion. This could describe the diffusion of a molecule inside a long nanotube, along a channel in a zeolite or along a path into an enzyme's active site. At any particular point, the molecule could be buffeted by a solvent molecule and knocked forwards or backwards. To idealize the problem we assume that each displacement or step is of the same length. More colourfully, it has become the convention in textbooks to describe a random walk as the meanderings of the proverbial drunkard.\n",
    "In the simulation of a random walk, only discrete steps can be taken $1, 2, 3 \\cdots$ and so on. A random walk of this discrete type is described as a Markov chain of events in which the next event to occur depends only on the current situation or state and has no history of past events because each event has to be independent of all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The walk is random and also unbiased, which means that the chance of moving to the right or to the left at any step is equal to $1/2$. Suppose that a walk can have only two steps, then there are four ways of moving and only three places the walk can end up, which is either where it started, or two steps to the left, or two to the right. The chance of two left moving steps, or a left and a right, is $1/4$. Similarly, the chance of a right-hand step and then a left-hand one, or of two right steps, is $1/4$. The chance, therefore, of returning to the starting place is $1/2$, and it is $1/4$ of moving, either two places to the right, or two to the left, of the start. After three steps, the walker can have moved three steps to the right or to the left, or two right and one left, and vice versa, or two left and one right, and vice versa. After an odd number of steps, the walker cannot be at the start of the walk. Clearly, the number of combinations of left and right steps soon becomes complicated but it is, nevertheless, calculable. The probability of ending up at different positions is shown in the table. The sums of each row add to one as these entries represent probability. These probabilities can be calculated by the binomial distribution, and, when fractions are cleared, Pascal's triangle results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an unbiased random event if $p$ is the probability of success in any single event, the probability of $k$ successes after $n$ attempts is the binomial distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle  P(k,n,p)=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k\\left( 1-p \\right)^{n-k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and for example the chance of throwing a die three times so that each time the same number appears is $P(3, 3, 1/6) = 1/63$, the $1/6$ appears because there a 6 sides on a die. The factor \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}=\\binom{n}{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is called the binomial coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the random walk, 'success' means that after a total of $n$ steps, the walker is at position $k$ steps away from the starting point. To calculate this probability, suppose that in a random walk of length $2n$, there are $x$ steps taken to the right, then $2n - x$ must be taken to the left. Therefore, the walker ends at position $x -(2n - x) = 2(x - n)$. If $x$ steps are taken to the right out of a total of $2n$ then the probability of this is\n",

    "## 3.3 Simulation of one-dimensional diffusion, Brownian motion\n",
    "\n",
    "In diffusion, time, and distance are linked by Fick's second law; Chapter 10.6.2 (iv). However, in a simulation, this equation is not used and the position where the walk ends after a fixed number of total jumps is calculated. This is repeated many times and a histogram made of the final positions. To make the walk last a longer time, a larger total number of jumps is taken because each jump is supposed to take an equal time. In the Monte Carlo simulation, the total number of steps, s, must be decided beforehand. The walk must start at only one place, say $x_0$, and as there is an equal chance of moving to the right or left, the starting place of the walk will also be the mean value $\\langle x_0 \\rangle$. The root mean square distance the walker moves in taking $s$ steps, is $\\sqrt{s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a random number generator in the range $0 \\to 1$ to determine the direction of each step, the position where the walker ends after completing the total number of steps is recorded. This value is stored in an array. It is important to remember to calculate the result only where the walker stops after the total number of steps is completed, and to record this value. To prevent the walker leaving either end of the array used to hold the final positions, we could make the array many times   s so the walk cannot reach the end within the number of allotted steps. Alternatively, and more reliably, we can check when the ends are reached, but this will make the calculation a little slower. Finally, the calculation is repeated to improve the statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the walk at the centre of the array prob, by making its length an odd number n, then the centre is at $(n - 1)/2$. If the walk consists of an even number of steps, then the walker must end up an even number of positions away from the starting point, $0,\\; \\pm 2,\\; \\pm 4$, and so forth. Stored in an array, these steps leave every odd-numbered array index as zero. To avoid having a graph with every other point as zero, the change in the number of positions away from the starting point can be divided by two, because it is an even number, and then added to the index of the starting point $(n - 1)/2$. The variable m in the code below is the number of jumps away from the start. The algorithm below only works, as written, for an even number of steps in a walk, or as $2n$ steps for odd-numbered $n$. To calculate the distance moved, a second array must contain only even numbers with the value zero at the starting point index $(n - 1)/2$; this is array $\\mathtt{xdata}$. Each jump is taken to be one time step; therefore, the number of jumps is equivalent to time.\n",

The fraction going to C would be $k_B/(k_D+k_B)$ and this is made by examining whether the random number is in the range $0 \\le k_B/(k_D+k_B)$ or greater than this.\n",

    "\n",
    "In synthetic polymers the length of the chain is determined entirely by random events. In addition reactions it depends the lifetime of the carrier chain and in condensation reactions by the presence of a reactive group. These process are random in nature and they add monomer molecules in a step-wise manner to the chain, but the chains do not grow endlessly because there is a small but finite chance of being terminated that happens at random. Consequently, any polymer has a distribution of chain lengths and hence molar mass and this distinguishes polymers from simple molecules. The chain length can be calculated statistically and the number and weight average molar mass of polymer chains is given in Chapter (Summations & Series) 5-4.2. The process can also be simulated as outlined next. The features of step-growth polymerisation are (J. Cowie & V. Arrighi Polymers: Chemistry and Physics of Modern materials publ. CRC Press 2007 3rd ed.) \n",

    "(1) Any two molecular species can react,\n",
    "(2) Most monomers are incorporated early on in the reaction.\n",
    "(3) The chain length increases steadily during reaction.\n",
    "(4) High conversion is needed to form long polymers which also takes time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(i) Algorithm 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of chain lengths is computed using a Monte-Carlo method. An array is made whose indices each represent one polymer chain. The value at each index gives the length of the chain, initially set to zero. At each step in the simulation the number $1$ is added to each element of the array, unless a random termination event has occurred and then a zero is added for this step and all future ones at this index, i.e. this particular chain's growth is halted. After repeating this many times a histogram is made of the chain lengths. The histogram records how many chains of a given length occur and groups these into 'bins' of a given width. A plot is made of the number of events (length of the chain) vs. the length itself. The random or Monte-Carlo part enters only in the termination step. A certain number of chains are chosen at random to be terminated on each round, this means that we must know the extent of reaction labelled $p$. The longer the rounds adding a molecule go on for, the longer the chain gets but also the greater the chance of termination. Thus, at the end of the process there are many chains of short length and fewer long ones. The maximum chain length is the number of rounds or repetitions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(ii) Algorithm 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a second way of calculating the length distribution that is similar to the method developed in the previous section for an excited state. In this we determine the length of the chain at termination, rather than time of decay, from the probability of reacting and compute the length at which it is terminated, repeat this many times and then form a histogram. The lifetime $\\tau$ used with a decaying molecule is replaced by the chain length, $tau$ being the length at which the distribution of lengths has fallen to $1/e\\approx 0.37$ of its initial value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(iii) Statistical approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to answer the question; how shall we know that the Monte-Carlo simulation represents anything approximating theory or even reality? To answer this we need to use statistical theory model the distribution of polymer chain lengths. The number and weight averages can be calculated from the Monte-Carlo data, but these are only point measures of the polymer's length and mass distribution, the distributions themselves are really needed. Using arguments based on probability these distributions can be calculated (Cowie & Arrichi 2007), and the starting point is Carothers' equation. Carothers pioneered step-growth reactions and invented nylon 66. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x_n$ be the number average chain length which is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle x_n=\\frac{n_0}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_0$ is the original number of molecules present as monomers, and $n$ the number of all molecules able to react at a later time $t$, which included all potentially reactive polymers. The total number of functional groups that have reacted is therefore $(n_0-n)$  and then the extent of reaction $p$ is the fraction\n",

    "$$\\displaystyle x_n=\\frac{1}{1-p}=\\frac{n_0}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is particularly useful. Suppose there is $50$% reaction then the average chain length is surprisingly only $2$. It follows that if we want a long average chain length of, say, $100$ then $p$ has to be large, e.g. when $x_n = 100, p = 0.99$ which means $99$% conversion therefore the reaction must be driven almost to completion. This also gives us an indication that in our simulation $p$ has to be very close to unity. \n",
    "\n",
    "A chain grows as monomers are added, and if there are $x$ chains at time $t$ then $x-1$ are left after the next step and the probability that $(x-1)$ groups have reacted is $p^{x-1}$, where $p$ is the extent of reaction. A group unreacted has a probability of $(1-p)$ and therefore the probability $p_x$ of finding a chain of $x$ units long is the product of reacting up to that time and not yet having reacted which is \n",

    "The code to do the algorithm 1 simulation is shown below. The array 'chains' represents the polymers, the value at each index is the polymer length, e.g. chains[4] = 10 means that chain $4$ has length $10$. The array 'term' is either $1$ or $0$ and the whole array is added to the chains. Python allows whole arrays to be added without specifying indices but using $[:]$. The parameter $z$ is the number of chains to be terminated at each round. The plots are scaled to take into account the width of the bins used in the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes when making the histogram, the way the histogram's algorithm works to partitions the number of events into each bin can sometimes cause points to appear in a regular pattern being either too high or too low or both. This unphysical behaviour can be corrected by choosing a different number of bins, for example by doubling, plotting, re-choosing, re-plotting etc. until this effect disappears. "

    "\n",
    "In reactions where we are not particularly interested in the time course but in their equilibrium a straightforward approach is to allow the reaction to occur at each step of the simulation and count the number of each type of molecule present. The reaction $\\mathrm{N_2O_4} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{2NO_2}$ or in general $A \\rightleftharpoons 2B$ is used as an illustration. If we start with only A molecules then we expect A to decrease and B increase until the rate forwards is equal to the rate back when equilibrium is reached. The equilibrium mole fraction of A and B will change with the initial amount of A. If at equilibrium more A is added then we expect the reaction to produce more B, and vice-versa. We can test this with the Monte-Carlo calculation, the key point being that at each step we add to or subtract from the total A and B molecules depending on whether a forwards or reverse reaction has been chosen. First we will workout what the maximum fraction of sites A can initially fill because there are only a finite number of them. The algorithm and details set out below is based on that by Kraska (J.

    "Figure 11c shows the mole fraction as the reaction evolves, with an initial number of $2000$ A molecules. After about $25000$ steps each mole fraction has become constant and equilibrium is reached. This can also be determined by plotting the reaction rate for $A\\to 2B$ and $2B\\to A$.

    "and these are equal at equilibrium as can be seen on the right of fig 11b. As the number of 'molecules' is relatively small, $\\le 10000$ fluctuations about equilibrium can be seen. Using eqn 13a the mole fraction can be calculated as $(n_0-n_e)/(n_0+n_e)$ and compared to that obtained from the simulation. For the data in fig 11b the mole fraction of A is $0.214$ while that from eqn 11a is $0.208$. The comparison the the calculated values of the mole fraction vs. the simulated ones show that the two numbers agree to two decimal places when rounded, and the largest difference being when $n_0$ is small.\n",

    "If, when equilibrium is reached, the number of A or B is changed and a new equilibrium position will be reached eventually as more A will convert to B or *vice versa*. This change is done at constant volume as the number of sites is unchanged in the simulation. This is shown in figure 11c, where there are initially $n_0=2000$ A and after $\\approx 40000$ steps $1000$ more A are added to vacant sites. The final mole fractions and rates are those as if initially $n_0=3000$. \n",

    "When the addition is made the mole fraction of A suddenly rises and that of B falls, simply because the total mole fraction must add to one. The rates on the other hand (as shown in the right hand panel) are proportional to the numbers of A and B and we can see that as more A is injected the number of these suddenly rise then slowly fall as the predominant reaction is, until equilibrium is established, $A\\to B$. The number of B rises continuously until equilibrium is re-established. If B had been added the similar behaviour is observed but with A and B reversed. This behaviour when returning to equilibrium accords with that expected when perturbing an equilibrium and expressed as the Le Chatelier principle.\n",
