    "### Q17 answer\n",
    "There are $5! = 120$ ways of arranging the numbers. They could all be listed, starting with $12345$, and ending at $54321$ as the largest and counted off. This is possible, but tedious. Instead, think of the numbers as five groups of four digits each, containing $4! = 24$ elements. If $x$ is a digit, the first ordered group of $24$ numbers starts with $1xxxx$, the second, $2xxxx$ starts at the $25^{th}$ number in the list and so forth. The $33^{rd}$ number is therefore in the second group. Next, split the numbers $xxxx$ into four groups of three digits making $3! = 6$ numbers each, and call them $yyy$. The first sets of numbers in group $2$ are $21yyy, 23yyy, 24yyy$ etc. The $33^{rd}$ can be found now just by enumerating, although the $yyy$ could be split into three groups of $2!$ numbers each producing $213zz, 231zz, 241zz$ etc. Putting in the values for $zz$ starting at the $25^{th}$ number gives\n",

    "(a) The fraction of $^{13}$C is $(12.011 - 12)/12 = 0.011$ or approximately 1/91. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) The chance that both carbons are $^{13}$C is $(1/91)(1/91) = 1/8281$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) One $^{13}$C appears with a chance $1/91$ and there is a $1 - 1/91= 90/91$ chance that it does not appear. Two $^{13}$C have a chance of $(90/91)^2$ that they do not occur and therefore $1 - (90/91)^2 = 181/8281$ is the chance that a $^{13}$C appears at least once. Alternatively, we can argue that if at least one carbon is $^{13}$C, the chance of this occurring is the sum of the chance that carbon $1$ is $^{13}$C or atom $2$ is $^{13}$C less the chance that both carbons are $^{13}$C.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{91}+\\frac{1}{91}-\\frac{1}{91^2}=\\frac{181}{8281}\\approx 0.0219 $. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relative size of the NMR signal is this result multiplied by the cube of the ratio of magnetogyric ratios, which is $\\approx 3.5 \\cdot 10^{-4}$ making it clear why $^{13}$C spectra are more difficult to obtain than $^1$H. Furthermore, as the signal to noise increases only as $\\sqrt{n}$ for $n$ scans, this makes obtaining good quality $^{13}$C spectra very time consuming.\n",

    "### Q19 answer\n",
    "(a) This is effectively the same problem as tossing two coins. The four possible outcomes are 'AA', 'Aa', 'aA',and 'aa' of which the middle two are the same, therefore, the incidences are $p^2,\\; 2p(1 - p)$, and $(1 - p)^2$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) The chance that an individual is 'aa' is is the fraction \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\frac{(1-p)^2}{p^2+2p(1-p)+(1-p)^2}=(1-p)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the joint chance that an individual has both 'A' and 'a' genes  $2p(1 - p)$, then, by equation 24, the probability of not being 'aa' but having an 'a' gene is $2p(1 - p)/(1 - p)^2$.\n",

    "(a)$p=V_A/(V_A +V_B)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) For $N$ molecules,the chance of all molecules being in volume $V_A$ becomes a product of individual ones since one molecule does not influence any other. The result is $\\left(V_A/(V_A + V_B)\\right)^N$. For equal volumes and only $100$ molecules, the probability is extremely small $p = 1/2^{100} \\approx 8 \\cdot 10^{-31}$. For $1000$ molecules, this probability becomes infinitesimal $\\approx 10^{-301}$. If a mole of gas molecules were present this chance is so small that it has been effectively zero since the universe began and is likely to be so until it ends. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) In this question the initial volume is $V_A$ and expansion is into the total volume, thus the chance is the inverse of that in (a). The entropy change is positive and is \n",

    "$$\\displaystyle S=Nk_B\\ln\\left( \\frac{V_A + V_B}{V_A} \\right)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q23 answer\n",
    "The number of spin states is $6$ for p and $10$ for d orbitals because electrons are fermions. The number for the N atom is the combination $C(6, 3) = 6!/(3!3!) = 20$ and $C(10, 6) = 10!/(6!4!) = 210$ for the Fe atom.\n",

The symmetry in the number of microstates is also clear; we can count electrons up to d$^5$ or equivalently 'holes' from d$^5$ to d$^{10}$. Using Python the number can be calculated as shown below"

In the product each can have three ways of arranging the isotopes; for example $35-35-37,\\, 35-37-35,\\, 37-35-35$.

    "The important words here are 'at least' which means that we look for the chance that the event does not happen. The chance of _not_ observing one six is $5/6$ and in four throws, as they are independent, is $(5/6)^4$. Therefore, the chance of observing at least one six in four throws is $1 - (5/6)^4 = 0.518$ , which is slightly better than  evens or $50$% chance of winning. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the chance of observing two sixes in $24$ throws is $1 - (35/36)^{24} = 0.491$ and, as there is less than a $50$% chance of winning, money will inevitably be lost. Had the Chevalier insisted instead on gambling that two sixes would be produced in $25$ throws he would have, perhaps, not lost his money. He is remembered because he asked Pascal to help work out out the odds of success and failure and so helped to found probability theory.\n",
