    "### 5.2 Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "In electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays or radio waves and, more familiarly, visible light, the periodic displacement of the electric and magnetic fields is described by a sine or cosine function. Similarly, sine and cosine describe the periodic displacement of molecules as a sound wave travels through a gas, liquid, or solid, and describe a molecule's internal vibrational normal modes. Any motion described by a single sine or cosine is called simple harmonic motion (SHM), for example, the motion of a pendulum. A spring is often called a harmonic oscillator and this term is also used to describe molecular vibrations. Mathematically, waves form the basis of the Fourier transforms and Fourier series method described in Chapter 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sine wave is defined by its wavelength, amplitude, and phase. The amplitude is its maximum vertical displacement from zero. The wavelength is one full or two half periods and is the distance from one node to the next but one. A node is any of the points where the wave has zero amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a _longitudinal wave_, such as a sound wave, the gas molecules are made to move about their equilibrium position in simple harmonic motion by the disturbance generating the sound. This simple harmonic motion occurs along the direction that the wave travels. The wave moves through the gas because molecules interact with one another causing regions of increased pressure and rarefaction. Even though each molecule only moves about its equilibrium position as it does so, it influences its neighbour and the wave moves. A Mexican Wave at a football or cricket match is an example of how the wave moves but each particle (a person in this case) does not move from equilibrium. The speed of the wave is governed by how well one molecule (person) interacts with its neighbour and therefore depends on the properties of the medium. In a gas, the speed is $v = \\sqrt{\\gamma RT/M}$ where $\\gamma$ is the ratio of heat capacities at constant pressure and volume which is $1+2/5$ for an ideal diatomic gas and $5/3$ for an ideal atomic gas such as argon. A helical 'slinky' spring toy can be seen to exhibit longitudinal waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In _transverse waves_, such as a water wave, electromagnetic radiation, or a taut wire in a guitar or violin, the displacement of the particles about equilibrium is at right angles to the direction in which the wave is travelling. In a taut wire the wave's velocity is $v = \\sqrt{T/\\mu}$ where $T$ is the tension ( the force in Newtons ) and $\\mu$ the mass per unit length. The units are $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{N}{(kg/m)}\\right)^{1/2}\\equiv \\left(\\frac{kg m/s^2}{(kg/m)}\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{m}{s}$.\n",

After one period, it is at the same displacement. Right: The particle's motion is shown with time; the wave is $y = \\sin(2\\pi \\upsilon t)$. After one or any whole number of periods the particle (circle) is again at the same displacement $y$.\n",

On the left the displacement $x$ is plotted and therefore as time progresses the particle moves up and down at fixed $x$. On the right the displacement vs time at a fixed $x$ is plotted.\n",

The combined wave has frequencies that are half the sum and half difference of the two fundamental waves. Figure 13 shows this effect on waves with $\\upsilon$ = 5 and 5.5 Hz.

    "with units distance/time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the medium is _dispersive_, as is air or glass to visible light, then $\\omega/k$ is not constant. Dispersion means that the medium through which the wave is passing affects the wave so that the phase velocity of the wave depends on the frequency; thus, red light is transmitted through the same piece of glass in less time than blue light. The refractive index at short (blue) wavelengths is larger than at longer wavelengths. The speed of light in a medium of refractive index $n_\\lambda$ at wavelength $\\lambda$ is $c_n = c/n_\\lambda$ where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum defined as $c=2.99792458\\cdot 10^8 \\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _group velocity_ $v_g$ is a second measure of the speed of a wave-like disturbance. It applies only when a wave is composed of many individual waves of different frequencies and is defined as $\\Delta \\omega /\\Delta k$. The superposition of these waves does not remain constant in time and therefore the profile of the disturbance changes with time, although each individual wave moves with its phase velocity. The group velocity is also the speed at which energy is transmitted and is the speed at which the maximum of the combined wave moves.\n",

This is normally the case for electromagnetic waves in an electrical conductor and in the far infrared part of the spectrum.

    "\n",
    "The fundamental and overtone waves formed in a taut wire when it is struck, such as on a guitar or violin, or those in the quantum mechanical particle in a box, are standing waves. They rise and fall in time with their nodes remaining at the same place. Thus, sometimes they are completely zero everywhere, and at other times they are maximal. When two similar waves travelling in opposite directions are added, a standing wave is formed. This can be shown if the waves are written as $y_1 = \\sin(k(x - v t))$, which means that the wave moves to the right along the x-axis with velocity $v$, and the wave $y_2 = A\\sin(k(x + v t))$ moves to the left. With some manipulation the sum of these waves is $y = 2\\cos(kvt)\\sin(kx)$, which is a sine wave which remains fixed along $x$ but whose amplitude rises and falls in time with frequency $\\omega = kv$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, if you strike the strings of a violin or piano the motion produced is complex because many fundamental frequencies (called normal modes) are simultaneously excited when the instrument is played. Some calculations that illustrate this are presented in Chapter 7. In musical instruments there are also many overtones produced and it is these that give instruments their characteristic sounds.\n",

Only some angles cause diffraction because $n$ is an integer and the values of $d$ are determined by the limited number spacing between atoms. As the incident and diffracted angle are equal at $\\theta$ the diffracted rays can be considered to be reflected off the lattice planes. Only the diffracted (reflected) waves that interfere constructively with one another to produce light spots on the detector.

    "### 6 Inverse functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The log and exponential functions are inverses of one another, and similarly $x^n$ and $x^{1/n}$ because when one is made a function of the other, the result is $x;\\; \\ln(e^x) = x$ and $(x^{1/n})^n = x$. If the function is written as $f(x)$ then the inverse is $f^{-1}(x)$, therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle f^{-1}[f(x)] = x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all functions have an inverse. When plotted the observation is that one function is the reflection of the other through a straight line of gradient $\\pm 1 $, such as shown in  figure 8 for the positive exponential and log. More formally, the function and its inverse must have a one-to-one relationship. If an inverse exists when the function $f (x)$ is solved for $x$, then $x$ and $y$ exchanged and the result substituted into the original equation, $x$ results. For example, if $f(x) \\equiv y = (x + 2)/3$ then $x = 3y - 2$, the inverse function is found by swapping $y$ for $x$, giving $f^{-1}(x) = 3x - 2$, and then substituting back $f^{-1}[f(x)] = 3(x + 2)/3 - 2 = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $y = \\sin(x)$ has $y = \\sin^{-1}(x)$ as its inverse function, which can be written as $\\sin(y) = x$, which is a sine wave moving up the y-axis, as shown in figure 16. Similarly there are inverse functions $\\cos^{-1}(x)$ and $\\tan^{-1}(x)$. Notice that the computer notation is different to the mathematical one; for example, $\\sin^{-1}(x) \\equiv \\arcsin(x)$, the prefix 'arc' being added to these inverse functions, but this notation is not universal and in some languages asin may be used instead of arcsin etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse trig functions are multi-valued; the principal range for $\\sin^{-1}(x)$ and $\\cos^{-1}(x)$ is $x = \\pm 1$ and the function's principal values lie between $y = \\pm \\pi/2$. The inverse function $\\tan^{-1}(x)$ is also multi-valued and ranges from $x = \\pm \\infty$ and has principal values between $y = \\pm\\pi/4$.\n",

    "### 7 Cartesian and polar coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "When drawing a graph a right-angled set of axes is normally used. The origin is the point (0, 0) and then any other point is represented by two numbers $(x,\\; y)$ in the x-y plane. In three dimensions the coordinates are $(x,\\; y,\\; z)$. These coordinates are described as rectilinear when right-angled axes are used and as Cartesian when $(x,\\; y,\\; z)$ are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways of defining a point in space and some of them will be used when the situation requires it. In crystallography, for example, it is often sensible to define axes of particular crystal types that are not always at 90$^\\text{o}$ to one another and of unequal length. Monoclinic and trigonal crystal types, among others, have these 'sloping' axes. On the surface of a sphere, such as the earth, there are no straight lines, and latitude and longitude, which are angles, are used to define a location. In other situations, for example defining the three-dimensional shapes of atomic orbitals, spherical polar coordinates are used and in these coordinates, two angles and a radius define a point. These coordinates are used because they reflect the underlying symmetry of the problem and equations become easier to solve. In the hydrogen molecule, prolate spheroidal coordinates are used. These have two origins, one at each atom, see Figure 30 for a sketch of coordinates. In other situations, cylindrical coordinates are used. There are many other coordinate systems, see Arkfen (1970) for a description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using different coordinate systems is not to make life difficult, far from it, but is that calculations are often easier done in these coordinates than in Cartesians; the disadvantage of these other coordinate systems is only unfamiliarity. In each case, it is possible to convert from one coordinate 'system' to another. In spherical polar coordinates the radius $r$ is the distance of a point from the origin, $\\theta$ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis and $\\phi$ the azimuthal or equatorial angle measured in the x-y plane from the x- to the y-axis. The conversion between Cartesian and _spherical polar_ coordinates is\n",

It is perhaps more intuitive since the factorial can be defined as $(n + 1 )! = (n + 1)n!$ or as $n! = n(n-1)!$ which is the form used in the next algorithm."

    "The polynomials used to define wavefunctions in quantum mechanics can be calculated by recursion and while there are other ways of calculating them, such as the generating function method, see Chapter 9, recursion is often convenient. The Hermite polynomials $H_n(x)$ describe part of the wavefunctions of the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, as used to describe vibrations of a molecule, and the other parts multiply the Hermite by a normalization constant and by $e^{-x^2/2}$. In the Hermite polynomial, $n$ is an integer $n \\ge 0$ representing the quantum number, and $x$ is proportional to the displacement of the oscillator from equilibrium.
