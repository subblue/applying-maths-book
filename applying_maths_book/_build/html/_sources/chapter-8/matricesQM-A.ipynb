    "The Schroedinger equation (1) can be solved, in principle, by integration in the same manner as other similar differential equations and the energies $E$ and wavefunctions $\\varphi$ determined,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V(x)\\right)\\varphi=E\\varphi \\qquad\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varphi$ is a function of $x$, although this is often not explicitly stated. Unfortunately an algebraic solution turns out to be possible only for a few potentials $V(x)$. Luckily, among these are the rather useful ones, the harmonic and Morse oscillator, the particle in a box or on a ring, the rigid rotor and the hydrogenic type atoms with a single electron. Flugge (1999) gives several more one dimensional examples. For other problems, for example, to predict an NMR spectrum or that of a non-rigid rotor the equation is solved by recasting it in a basis set and using the properties of eigenvalue - eigenvector matrices. This is in essence an algebraic method although numerical values can be calculated. The Schroedinger equation can also be solved numerically for an arbitrary potential, by using one of several integration methods; see Chapter 11. However, numerical integration does not easily lend itself to predicting trends and identifying important parameters and limits, which an algebraic solution does.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has two parts, the first assumes some knowledge of basis sets and several problems are solved using them and in the second part, basis sets and _bra-ket_ algebra are described. How these objects are manipulated is illustrated. If you are unfamiliar with these topics, it may be worth looking at the second part first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing the Schroedinger equation as $H\\varphi = E\\varphi$ is the conventional shorthand that represents the following set of simultaneous equations\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle H^0\\varphi_0=E_0\\varphi_0, \\qquad H^0\\varphi_1=E_1\\varphi_1, \\qquad\\cdots \\qquad H^0\\varphi_i=E_i\\varphi_i\\qquad\\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "one for each of the possibly infinite number of energy levels. The superscript zero, e.g. $H^0$ indicates that this operator exactly solves the Schroedinger equation with wavefunctions $\\varphi_i$. These wavefunctions $\\varphi_i$ are orthogonal to one another because each describes an eigenstate of the particular potential used and are assumed to have been normalized. The orthonormality condition is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\int\\varphi_n^*\\varphi_mdx=\\delta_{n,m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The superscript * represents the complex conjugate, which means that if the wavefunction is complex replace $i$ with $-i$ and vice versa. If it is not complex, i.e. 'normal' the complex conjugate changes nothing. In Dirac 'bra-ket' notation the orthogonality and normalization of the wavefunctions is written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\langle\\varphi_n | \\varphi_m \\rangle = \\delta_{n,m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta$ is the Kronecker delta such that $\\delta_{n,n} = \\delta_{m,m} = 1$ and if $n \\ne m$; $\\delta=0$. The subscripts $i = 0, 1, 2, \\cdots$ are used to label the whole set of energy levels but the subscripts $n$ and $m$ are reserved to represent individual levels should that be necessary and are also the quantum numbers. If the harmonic oscillator were being described, quantum number $i$ would extend to infinity. In contrast, spin only has a finite set of quantum numbers; two for the spin state of the electron $i = -1/2, 1/2$ and three for the nuclear spin state of $^{14}$N or $^2$H, $0, \\pm 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Expectation Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation or average value for the lowest level $0$ is the energy $E_0$. It is calculated by left multiplying equation 2 by $\\varphi^*_0$ and integrating over all space $x$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle E_0=\\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi_0^*H^0\\varphi_0 dx}{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi_0^*\\varphi_0 dx} =\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi_0^*H^0\\varphi_0 dx \\qquad\\tag{3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and because the wavefunction is normalized, $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi_0^*\\varphi_0 dx=1$. The same procedure can be followed for every other level to calculate $E_n$. Any energy can be written in equivalent ways as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle E_n=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi_n^*H^0\\varphi_n dx\\equiv \\langle \\varphi_n^*|H^0|\\varphi_n\\rangle = \\langle n|H^0|n\\rangle \\qquad\\tag{4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the latter two expressions being in Dirac's bra-ket notation, explained in Section 4 together with basis sets. Note that the bra $\\langle \\varphi^*_n|$ is always the complex conjugate of the wavefunction $\\varphi$, but it is not common to label it as such, therefore the bra can be written as $\\langle \\varphi_n|$. The ket is $|\\varphi_n\\rangle$. In general, if $S$ is an operator, its expectation is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle S_{n,n}=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi_n^*S\\varphi_n dx\\equiv \\langle \\varphi_n^*|S|\\varphi_n\\rangle=\\langle n|S|n\\rangle \\qquad\\tag{5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the operator $S$ is position $x$, the expectation value is the average position, if momentum, whose operator is $-i\\hbar (d/dx)$, then $S$ is the average momentum and so forth. When two different states $n$ and $m$ interact under the action of the operator $S$, the notation used is similar\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle S_{n,m}=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi_n^*S\\varphi_m dx\\equiv \\langle \\varphi_n^*|S|\\varphi_m\\rangle=\\langle n|S|m\\rangle \\qquad\\tag{5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactions between different levels $n$ and $m$ lead to interesting effects, and this chapter describes how these may be calculated. No interaction occurs if $S = H^0$ because $H^0$ exactly solves the Schroedinger equation with wavefunctions $\\varphi_i$, which are orthogonal,\n",

Clearly, to do any of these calculations the wavefunctions $\\varphi$ have to be known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of using a different potential is calculated next. Hamiltonian $H$ has a new term in the potential energy, and this manifests itself as off-diagonal terms in the $H_{nm}$ matrix equation 8. The hamiltonian can be written as\n",

In some problems, such as the NMR nuclear spin example given below, the wavefunctions are never known, only their integrals with the angular momentum operator, which means that $H_{nm}$ is known directly. In problems that have a large number of states, such as an anharmonic oscillator, a huge matrix will be needed to calculate accurate values of the energies because there are many non-zero, off-diagonal terms. In this case, the larger the matrix is, the more accurate the answers become, provided numerical accuracy can be maintained. In examples involving electron or nuclear spin, the matrix has a finite size that completely determines the problem, and accurate results are obtained from small matrices. "

The harmonic oscillator wavefunctions $\\varphi$ would no longer be 'diagonal in the eigenstates' meaning that the wavefunctions $\\varphi$ that are solutions with $H^0$ are not solutions of the Schroedinger equation with the new potential. With the new potential, some, if not all of the off-diagonal expectation values (matrix elements) $H_{23}, H_{53}$ for example will no longer be zero.

One solution to this problem is to solve the Schroedinger equation with the quartic potential, $V^1$, using the harmonic wavefunctions $\\varphi$ as a basis, and so obtain the quartic eigenvalues (energies) and eigenvectors in terms of these $\\varphi$. The eigenvectors $v$ are used to _expand_ the unknown wavefunctions $\\psi$ in terms of the known ones $\\varphi$. A basis set to describe the new wavefunctions has to be constructed.

    "**(iii)**$\\quad$ If the number of levels is infinite then clearly the calculation cannot be completed exactly. In this case, the $\\psi$ and the corresponding energies are approximate but improve as more energy levels are added. This improvement occurs because the energy levels are coupled one to another and including more of them allow more couplings to be added.\n",

    "**(iv)**$\\quad$ If the number of levels is finite as in spin problems such as NMR, then the result is exact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(v)**$\\quad$ A basis set of any orthogonal set of functions could be chosen for the functions $\\varphi$ as shown in the generalized Fourier method, Chapter 9.4. However, it is natural to try to choose a set of basis functions that have a similar shape to those the new wavefunctions are expected to look like. A good guess will make the off-diagonal terms relatively small, and when diagonalized, which has the effect of mixing all the matrix elements together, the resulting diagonal terms will only be slightly different from the un-diagonalized ones.\n",

The wavefunction may be negative; this will depend on the sign of eigenvectors that are only defined to within $\\pm 1$. Negative values are just as correct as positive ones. The wavefunction $\\psi$ is constructed according to equation 11; the eigenvector values are the constants $v$. The wavefunctions are very close to the true ones as may be seen by looking at Figure 4.48 in the solutions. The reason that the match between the basis set expansion and the true values is better with a bigger basis set is because there are more sine functions and more variables $v$ to match to the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions. The same is true for a series expansion; the more terms the better the expansion will match the function. \n",

The potential becomes steeper and therefore the energy levels are farther apart."

    "The pure nuclear Zeeman effect, which gives rise to the NMR spectrum will be calculated. In this calculation, and every other involving spin, the matrix element integrals $H_{nm}$ are evaluated directly from the properties of the angular momentum operators, and the spin wavefunctions can never be known. (Spin eigenfunctions unlike angular momentum do not depend on spatial coordinates; as a result, they do not have to satisfy a periodicity condition and can have half integer quantum numbers. Angular momentum, such as possessed by a rigid rotor molecule has integer quantum numbers.) \n",

    "NMR is extremely widely used in chemistry and biochemistry because the spectrum is a measure of the structure of the (diamagnetic) molecule. The many lines in the typical NMR spectrum have two main origins. One is caused by the local magnetic field of the molecule's electrons shielding the nuclei from the external field and is called the *chemical shift*. The other, $J$ coupling, is due to the local field caused by indirect _spin-spin_ or indirect _dipole - dipole_ interaction mediated by the electrons in the chemical bond. Because both effects are local this enables the structure to be determined. Generally, enough detailed information is generally present to allow this, but not so much that the spectrum is too complicated to be interpreted.\n",
