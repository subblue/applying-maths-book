    "Differential equations dominate the study of the motion of the planets and of molecules. In single molecules or in ensembles of them, molecular dynamics calculations rely on solving many simultaneous equations according to Newton's laws of motion, linked to potentials describing intermolecular interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's laws are\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i)**$\\quad$ Every particle remains either in a state of rest or of constant speed in a straight line unless acted on by a force to change that state.\n",

    "**(ii)**$\\quad$ The rate of change of the momentum of a particle is proportional to the force acting on it and is in the direction of the force.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(iii)**$\\quad$ Action and reaction are equal and opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first law states that any acceleration experienced by a particle is caused by the action of an external force. The second law proposes that force $f$ is equal to the product of mass and acceleration since momentum is the product of mass and velocity;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle  f = m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = m\\frac{dv}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is position, $v$ velocity, and $t$ time. The second law includes the first, for if the force is zero then so is the acceleration and the body must remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third law asserts that if two particles exert forces on one another, the force exerted by the first on the second is equal to that exerted by the second on the first. This law can be used to define the mass of a particle.\n",

    "Newton's law of gravity was formulated to understand the motion of the planets. It states that the force of attraction of two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and the inverse square of their separation $r$,\n",

It describes the _small_ angular oscillations of a pendulum as well as a good approximation to the vibrations of molecules, and this is called the harmonic oscillator model. A spring that hangs vertically with a mass attached to its end, a taut wire with a mass attached at it centre, or the oscillations of a ship or of a hydrometer, all follow simple harmonic motion, if the inertia of the spring, wire, or liquid is ignored. In this motion, the acceleration is proportional to the displacement of the particle from its central position. \n",
