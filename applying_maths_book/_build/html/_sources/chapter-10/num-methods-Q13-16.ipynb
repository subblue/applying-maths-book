    "**Q13** This question illustrates the importance of using accurate numerical algorithms. Compare the Euler, modified Euler, and Runge - Kutta method to integrate the coupled equations (11.32) from $0 \\to 20$ with initial values, $x_0 = 2,\\; y_0 = 1$ at $t = 0$ and integration $500$ points. Plot $y$ vs time for the three methods. The exact solution for $y$ to the equation, which can be obtained by the methods of Chapter 10, is $y = \\sin(t) + 2e^{-t} - 1$ and thus at small times the function should decay exponentially then become sinusoidal.\n",
