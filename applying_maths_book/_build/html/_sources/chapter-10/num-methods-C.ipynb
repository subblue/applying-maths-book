    "### 5 Coupled equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar numerical methods to those used for single equations can be used to solve coupled or simultaneous ones. Coupled reactions are commonly found in chemical kinetics, MD simulations, enzyme kinetics, and catalysis; also in the decay of radioactive atoms as well as in the spread of diseases and the predator - prey type behaviour of animals. In each case, species interact or convert into one another and at least two differential equations are needed to describe this. In many cases, these sets of equations cannot be solved algebraically and a numerical method has therefore to be used. As an example, we deliberately start with a pair of equations that can be solved analytically, and this will allow comparison of the numerical solution with the algebraic one. The equations are\n",

    "subject to the initial condition $x(t_0) = 1,\\; y(t_0) = -3$ when $t_0 = 0$. Notice that the first equation $dy/dt = \\cdots$ is a function of $x$ and $t$ and the second a function of $y$ and $t$ but in general $dy/dt$ and $dx/dt$ could be functions of $x$, $y$, and $t$. These equations can be solved algebraically using the method of operators (Chapter 10.4) by making a second-order equation out of the pair and the solutions are $y = \\sin(t) - \\sinh(t) - 1 - 2 \\cosh(t)$ and $x = \\cosh(t) + 2 \\sinh(t)$. These functions are plotted in Fig. 11 as dashed lines. The result of a modified Euler integration using Algorithm 15 from $t = 0 \\cdots 3$ is also shown as the solid lines with $N = 200$ steps.\n",

The wavefunction can be normalised at the end of the calculation ($\\int\\psi dx=1$) so these values are not critical. The function $f$ is known at all points via $V(x)$  but as noted the eigenvalue $E$ must be known. Note also the sign of $f(x)$ when using the Schroedinger equation $\\displaystyle f(x)= -\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right)$.  \n",

    "As an example calculation, the wavefunction of a quantum harmonic oscillator with $V= (k/2)x^2$ is calculated using  constants $\\mu=1,\\;\\hbar = 1,\\; k = 20 $. The eigenvalues are $\\displaystyle E_n=\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu} }\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. This method does not perform well when,for example, the potential has a double well and in conjunction with the shooting method because numerical precision becomes an issue. In this case more sophisticated algorithms are needed. These are usually the ones that are provided by the computer language you use, 'odeint' in Python/Scipy for example."
