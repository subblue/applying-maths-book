    "This chapter outlines several numerical techniques and associated algorithms which are needed to perform integrations and solve differential equations. These are written generically and with Python. Accurate and efficient ways of calculating results from theory is an essential tool for any scientist. Using computer algebra programs such as Sympy is a great boon because calculations can be done to great numerical precision and accuracy. However, in line with our objective of understanding the principles of how to solve problems, several techniques, which contain the essence of the method to be used, are outlined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these are understood, you will have the knowledge to understand the more complex 'black-box' methods that Maple, SymPy, or other software use.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To start this chapter, some details on numerical accuracy are reviewed; next simple integration methods are described with a few examples and problems. More difficult, and interesting, is the numerical integration of differential equations, some of which only have numerical solutions. The various methods used are explained. A different numerical approach is taken in the next chapter on Monte Carlo methods. Simple integration is rather slow by this method but integrating differential equations is very robust. Monte Carlo methods are very versatile at simulating physical processes, such as diffusion or fluorescence, and occasionally this is the only way to do the calculation. Simulation also provides a good way to understand the processes involved, some of which can be very complex and not always easily translated into differential equations.\n",

    "### 1.1 Rounding errors\n",
    "\n",
    "In many calculations, the errors introduced by the computer due to the way its integers and real numbers are manipulated do not matter. Sometimes, the answer the computer returns may be precise and will be printed to many decimal places; however, it may not be accurate. To understand this, the expression $(1 - x)^6$ is expanded as the series $1-6x+15x^2 -20x^3 +15x4 -6x^5 +x^6$ and this is plotted close to its minimum at $x\\approx 1$ in Fig.1. While the scale is small, $\\approx 10^{-13}$, determining the exact root of the equation numerically is difficult. Of course, we know it is at $1$, but the computer will not give this answer even using a Newton-Raphson iterative scheme. The reason for the noisy plot is because the alternating positive and negative terms in the summation add up to almost zero, and the rounding error in the precision with which the numbers are calculated becomes important, and this limits the accuracy of the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A real number is converted in the computer into a floating-point number represented as $x = \\pm 0.d_1d_2d_3d_4 \\cdot 10^y$ which only approximately represents the number; i.e. it is only accurate to a certain number of decimal places. The mantissa, is the fraction $0.d_1d_2d_3d_4$, where $d_1$ etc. are the digits $0\\cdots 9$. A floating-point number is usually described as a single or double precision and the number of decimal places is typically $7$ and $14$ respectively; this depends on the type of computer being used. Normally nowadays double precision is standard for example $17$ digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as seen in Fig. 1, 17 digits are not good enough to find the root; $25$ decimal places give a far more accurate result. The instruction Digits:= 25, sets $25$ decimal place precision for floating point numbers.\n",
    "Using the Newton-Raphson method (see Chapter 3.10), the root cannot be found accurately: the method is "

    "With typical double precision (16 decimal places), the root found is 1.0030182818841857, which is not even on the graph shown below, but furthermore it depends greatly on the starting value. If the function $(1 - x)^6$ is plotted directly without expanding, and hence without accumulating rounding errors, then the curve looks like that obtained with $25$ digits precision. This illustrates the important point that in many cases a small amount of algebra can significantly improve numerical calculations; errors rapidly accumulate with the repeated adding and subtracting of similarly sized numbers, and once an error is present it contaminates all subsequent results.\n",

    "\n",
    "In summing a series, the number of terms to be added has to be decided in advance. This automatically leads to an error that is nothing to do with arithmetical precision. The calculation should be repeated with more terms until the number of decimal places you require is continuously obtained. Rounding errors must additionally be considered, especially if the series contains alternating positive and negative terms; the errors can accumulate as the summation continues but will not be the same for all values of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the series $ \\displaystyle \\sin(x)=1-\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^5}{5!}-\\cdots$ which is valid for all $x$. If the series is summed up to the term $x^n/n!$ with $x \\gt 0$, the error is less than $\\displaystyle \\left| \\frac{x^{n+2}}{(n+2)!}\\right|$. The values of $\\sin(0.5)$ is $0.47942553$ whether calculated directly using Python or as the summation up to the $x^7$ term. If, however, $x$ is large, for instance $x = 5.5\\pi$, then we know by drawing a graph that  $sin(x) = -1$, but by summation up to $x^7$ the result is $-79258.34$: clearly this is ridiculous because $\\sin(x) \\le 1 $ for all $x$. Only if the number of terms in the summation is increased to at least terms $\\gt x^{59}$, and the numerical precision increased to $20$ decimal places can an accurate result be obtained from the series approach. In this instance, we know that the answer from the small summation is incorrect because the properties of $\\sin(x)$ are well known, but if you are summing a series whose result is unknown, then great care is necessary.\n",

Recall that $s= 1 - n* s$; is an assignment, meaning that the new value of $s$ is $1 - n \\times (current\\; value)$.

After about $n = 10$ it is difficult to judge which calculation gives the most accurate result, and by $n = 18$, both are clearly wrong. If integer constants  are used then accurate results are obtained for the direct integration, but using integers will not always be an option. \n",

    "### 1.4 Organized Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to be aware that recursion can sometimes lead to chaotic behaviour as a normal outcome of a calculation. This is a different sort of chaos to that just calculated; it is very much like 'organized chaos' and is not due to rounding or precision errors. Often this chaos is termed 'deterministic'. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is an important distinction therefore to be made between different types of 'Chaos'. In classical and quantum mechanics, in studying molecules for example, it is also observed that regular motion can suddenly become chaotic even though the underlying equations of motion do not indicate that this will necessarily happen. By 'chaotic' is meant that two starting conditions placed arbitrary close to one another in value, will lead to entirely different but _repeatable outcomes_ at some later time. If the cause of the chaos is due to rounding errors, the outcome is not repeatable but unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a short diversion into this interesting topic via a well-known example of deterministic chaos, first described in detail by May (1974, 1987) and May & Oster (1976), and called the *logistic map*. This arises from the recursive equation \n",

This equation works well only for some species such as bacteria but not for other more complex ones. The reaction $A+X\\leftrightharpoons 2X,\\quad X+B\\to C$ has the related rate equation $dX/dt=-(k_1A+k_2B)X+4k_2X^2$ if $[A],[B]$ are held constant.\n",

When the growth rate $r\\lt 1$ the population decreases from its initial value $x_0$ to zero. Only above $r\\ge 1$ does the population increase. As it does it rises rapidly, then oscillates before reaching a steady value.  However, at a value of $r\\ge 3$ bifurcation occurs, i.e. the oscillations persist indefinitely, and two values are alternately produced. As $r$ increases a little more, two periods are seen and four values exist, and these double again as $r$ continues to increase until eventually chaos ensues at about $r = 3.9$. Above $ r = 4 $, $x_n$ becomes negative, thus the valid range is $ 0\\lt r \\le 4$. Figure 1b shows this behaviour with an initial value of $x_0 = 0.1$.\n",

    "To be able to view the bifurcations more easily a plot of population $x_n$ vs $r$ is made and apparently random behaviour from otherwise regular behaviour is observed, Fig. 2. Some authors call this an orbit plot. The iteration is continued at each $r$ for at least a hundred steps to allow and initial oscillations to die out and become constant or to allow any constant oscillation to become steady or random depending on $r$. As $r$ increases the doubling multiplies to $4, 8, 16\\cdots $ and more numerous sets of numbers produce a random looking but regular pattern.   Figure 2 shows part of the plot.   The values up to $r=1$ are zero then they rise uniformly in a single curved line to join the plot shown. The initial pitchfork bifurcation at $r=3$ is clear as are the next few bifurcations (at each of which the number of points double) at $r\\approx 3.449, 3.5409, 3.5644\\cdots $ but then become too numerous to see on this plot. Pain (1993, chapter 12) and Strogatz 1994 chapter 10) both describe these non-linear and chaotic effects that have been observed experimentally as well as a detailed mathematical description of this topic.\n",

    "## 2 Numerical methods used to find the roots of an equation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secant method\n",
    "\n",
    "We now set aside the questions of numerical accuracy and chaos and look at some practical methods of numerically solving all sorts of equations. Sometimes in integration or in solving differential equations, the root of some function is required; three related numerical methods, the Secant, Regula Falsi, and bisection, are now described. The Newton - Raphson method has already been met in Chapter 3.10 and is used when the equation can be differentiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secant method is similar in idea to the Newton - Raphson method except that the derivative is expressed as a difference equation. If $f (x) = 0$ is the equation whose roots or $x$ values we want to find, then, in a recursive scheme, the next $x$ value is given by Newton - Raphson as $x_{n+1} = x_n  f(x_n)/f'(x_n)$ with $n = 0, 1, 2 \\cdots$ and $f'$ is the derivative with respect to $x$. Notice how similar this equation is to the general form of the logistic map in the previous section, i.e $x_{n+1}=f(x_n)$.  The $x_0$ value to start the calculation must be somewhere near to the root, and can be estimated by plotting the function. At the end of each step, the new value $x_{n+1}$ is substituted into the right-hand side of the equation, and the process is repeated until the absolute value of the function becomes less than some preset tolerance or the number of iterations is exceeded.\n",
    "In the secant method, the derivative is approximated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle f'(x_n)\\approx \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x}=\\frac{f(x_n)-f(x_{n-1})}{x_n-x_{n-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then substituting into the Newton - Raphson equation gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle  x_{n+1} = x_n -f(x_n)\\frac{x_n-x_{n-1}}{f(x_n)-f(x_{n-1})}  \\tag{1}$$\n",

    "## 3 Numerical integration\n",
    "Two methods of numerical integration have been briefly described in other chapters, one is the series expansion of a function and then a numerical evaluation of the terms; the other is the Euler - Maclaurin formula Chapter 5.7 and care needs to be exercised with both these methods. Three general and simpler methods are now outlined; these are the mid-point, the trapezoid, and Simpson's rule. More sophisticated numerical methods than these are described in Numerical Recipes (Prest et al. 1986) and similar specialized texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods divides the function to be integrated into small strips at predetermined abscissas, which are then multiplied by a certain constant number depending on the method, and added together. The integration becomes a summation, Fig. 3, and the general name for such a numerical integration method is *quadrature*. These methods are similar to the basic way we think about integration as the limiting area of a summation of rectangular strips as the width of each strip tends to zero. If the strips are fine enough, the result is a good approximation to the true value. In general, however, we do not initially know how many strips will be needed and some experimentation with this number is always necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be remembered that whatever numerical method is used, a polynomial is being integrated and not the original equation, and thus the ability of this to describe the curve will affect the results. The more sophisticated the method becomes, the higher the order of the polynomial used.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Drawing](num-methods-fig3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3. The trapezoidal rule approximates an integral with straight lines between points $x_1,\\, x_2,\\, \\cdots$, although not very well in this example, where the strips are too far apart to represent the function accurately. The mid-point method, on the other hand, evaluates the function half way between each point, three of which are shown by the vertical dotted lines.\n",
    "______\n",
    "### 3.1 Always try some algebra first\n",
    "There is always a tendency when using numerical methods to submit the equation directly to the computer. In many cases, however, performing some algebra first will help. This might mean simplifying the equation, removing constants to outside the integration, and, in particular, substitution of variables, which is done in standard integration. Consider the integral $\\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty (1+x^2)^{-1}dx$ This converges very slowly and makes the upper limit very large, which results in a slow calculation and potentially inaccurate numerical result. In fact, due to rounding errors, the result will get worse as the numerical integration proceeds. Some values of $1/(1 + x^2)$ are given in Table 2 and show that the maximum $x$ in the integration has to be at least $100$ for four-figure accuracy. This means that at least $1000$ points have to be used in the integration and even possibly $10,000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is needed is to transform the function into something less extended. The substitution $x = e^{uz} - 1$ where $u$ is a small constant will do this. Typically, $u = 5$, although this value is not critical. Differentiating $x = e^{uz} - 1$ gives $dx = ue^{uz}dz$, but the limits are still the same; $z = 0$ when $x = 0$ and $z = \\infty$ when $x = \\infty$. Making substitutions and simplifying a little makes the integral,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\int_o^\\infty \\frac{u}{2e^{-uz}+e^{uz}-2}dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The upper limit is still $\\infty$, but now this is not really important. If $z = 3$, the function in the integral has the value $\\approx 1.5\\cdot 10^{-6}$ making the whole expression virtually zero beyond this value, and so $3$ is the effective upper limit; quite an improvement on infinity. Additionally, fewer points in the integration are needed for the same precision.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mid-point integration assumes that the function is split equally into $N$ points, and any point is connected by a straight line to the next, thus ignoring any curvature between these points. Clearly, for a rapidly oscillating or varying function, many determinations of N will be needed to obtain an accurate answer. The mid-point method, not surprisingly, sums the values of the _function_ at the mid-point of each strip, $x_1^m \\; x_2^m \\cdots x_N^m $ as\n",

    "\n",
    "One advantage of this rule is that it enables functions with singularities in the integration range to be calculated. For instance, $1/(1 - x)$ is infinite at $x = 1$, but an integration spanning this point need not fail with the midpoint method but will do so with all other methods that calculate the function at integer increments of $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error in the integral calculated with the mid-point method is $\\displaystyle \\epsilon = \\pm\\frac{(b-a)^3f''(c)}{24N^2}$ and this will be greatly reduced by increasing the number of points $N$. The size of this error is found by calculating two points $c$ where the second derivative has its maximum and minimum in the range $a \\le c \\le b$, and choosing the largest absolute value. This can be the most difficult part of the calculation and is usually not worth the effort. It is easier to calculate the integral by doubling the number of points each time until a sufficient number of decimal places are unchanging in the result. The mid-point method is the simplest to calculate and gives accurate answers, yet it is hardly mentioned in textbooks compared to the two methods described next. Notice that, because the mid-points are used, there is one less point in the summation using the mid-point method than in the trapezoid or Simpson's method described next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mid point method is illustrated in the next algorithm where $e^{-x^2}$ is integrated from $0 \\to 1$. The exact value is $0.74682$ and the numerical value is $0.74690$ which is close and only used $20$ points in the integration, however, To obtain $5$ decimal place accuracy more than $100$ terms are needed."

In 1910, while at Manchester University, Rutherford deduced that the mass of the atom was not distributed like that in a raisin pudding throughout its volume, but concentrated at its centre in a very small dense nucleus, thus confirming a 'planetary' model of the atom. This laid the foundation for the old quantum (Bohr) model of the atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern version of this experiment, the nature of the force between two particles, such as atoms, molecules, or ions, is sought. A cold beam of atoms or molecules (particles) can be made by passing its gas through a small conical shaped aperture (a skimmer) into a region of high vacuum, typically $\\lt 10^{-6}$ torr. If the particles in one beam strike those in a second beam made in the same way, but at right angles, the particles can scatter off one another elastically. This scattering is not exactly like that of one snooker or billiard ball bouncing off another, but depends on the intermolecular potential energy between the particles. This may be mainly Coulombic if the particles are charged, but if neutral, then a Lennard-Jones potential better describes the interaction; see Fig. 30 (in solutions) for a graph of the potential. The angular position of the scattered particles can be used to calculate the form of the interaction potential. Nowadays detection of the particles' position is measured by a CCD camera with a scintillation plate in front of it. This converts a particle's kinetic energy into a photon. Alternatively, if this is not sensitive enough a specially designed particle detector has to be made and this moved from place to place to record the complete scattering pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry of the experiment is sketched in Fig. 4. The incident beam of particles, which has the shape of a cylindrical rod, is aimed towards the target atom. The potential energy between particles depends only on the separation of the particles; this is called a central force and the motion of the two particles about their centre of mass, can always be reduced to an equivalent one-particle problem, which means that the target can be considered to have infinite mass and therefore cannot move. If the incoming particles are initially off-axis they are deflected by the target and generally continue to travel away from their source but if they are more or less on axis they can be backscattered, orbit or sling-shot around the target.\n",

    "The incident particle starts at $-\\infty$ and a distance b off the axis, and has a total energy of $E_0$. The distance $b$ is called the _impact parameter_, Fig. 4, and is the distance by which the particles would miss one another if there were no interaction between them. The distance between the particles is the vector r, and the closest that they approach to one another is $r_0$. This minimum distance occurs in a repulsive potential at a distance greater than b, because the initial energy causes the incoming particle to rise up the potential 'hill' to an extent depending on its total energy. A more realistic potential, such as a Lennard-Jones 6-12, has both attractive and repulsive parts. The attractive part is usually more extended than the repulsive, so that the particles are attracted to one another at long range and repel at short range, consequently, the distance of closest approach can now be smaller than $b$.

This can usually be avoided by adding a small amount to $r_0$ and $10^{-6}$ was found to be sufficient to prevent this and not significantly affect the results. The largest positive root is sought by calculating from the largest $r$, which can be taken to be the same as the largest $b$, to the smallest $r$, finding a change in sign and then starting the bisection method. This is necessary because the $r_0$ equation can have three roots when $b$ is large. The function $g$, equation 10 is a function of $r$ and $b$, and when the substitution is made, $r$ is replaced.

When $b$ increases, the overall deflection can become zero. This is called a 'glory' and the initial energy and values of $b$ mean that the particles are initially attracted to one another, but the impact angle is glancing and, as the repulsive part of the potential is reached, just enough repulsion is present to return the particle on to its original path; the attractive and repulsive interactions exactly cancel.

    "In actual experiments and in quantum calculations, interferences between the different paths the same particle can take are observed. These must be absent in any classical calculation. Scattering is observed experimentally by performing molecular beam experiments and the scattering is, fortunately, not always elastic and chemical reactions can occur and this is called _reactive scattering_. These experiments have provided lots of fundamental information about chemical reactions and there are a number of clear descriptions of this, see, for example, Rigby et al. (1986), Steinfeld et al. (1999), Bernstein (1982), Eyring et al. (1980), and Hirst (1990)."
