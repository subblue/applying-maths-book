    "## 1.1 Types of equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equations are characterized into _ordinary_ and _partial_ ones. Ordinary differential equations only involve one independent variable and so have ordinary (total) derivatives; for example, the equation for a damped harmonic oscillator is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle m\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + a\\frac{dy}{dt} + bx = 0$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "with time $t$ as the independent variable, $m$, $a$, and $b$ are constants, and $y$ is the displacement at time $t$. Partial differential equations, such as the diffusion equation \n",

    "$$\\displaystyle D\\frac{\\partial ^2y}{\\partial x^2} =\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "have two or more independent derivatives, $t$ and $x$.\n",
    " \n",
    "Differential equations are solved by integration and as with any integration, constants of integration are produced. These constants determine the exact solution of a differential equation and are determined by the _initial values_ and/or the _boundary values_ where $y$ is given at some $x$ and $t$ values. Thus it _essential_  to determine the initial / boundary conditions when solving any differential equation. These initial and boundary conditions are determined by the physics/chemistry of the problem being studied, for example initial concentrations in a reaction or initial position of a pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different notations used in differential equation $dy/dx \\equiv y'$ or $y'(x)$. The second derivative is written as $y''$ and so on. An alternative notation is $\\dot y$ or $ \\ddot y $ etc., especially if the derivative is with respect to time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Initial Value Problems (IVP)\n",
    "\n",
    "In these problems, the starting conditions only are specified. For example, with the equation $dy/dt = ay$, the initial condition (or initial value) could be $y(t_0)$ = 2 where $t_0$ is the initial time, which is often zero. There is one initial condition because only a single integration step is necessary to solve the equation; the constant of integration is satisfied if $y$ is specified at one value of $t$. The initial value of $y$ and $t_0$ depends entirely on the problem being studied and is the equivalent of specifying the constant of integration in a normal integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the equation is of second or higher order, two, three, or more initial conditions apply. One condition is needed for each stage of integration. Suppose the equation\n",

    "\n",
    "i.e we know from the physics/chemistry we are studying that these are the initial values. Our aim is to follow what happens at later times by solving the differential equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second condition describes the gradient evaluated at time $t_0$ and what this gradient is depends on the problem being analysed. You can appreciate these initial conditions if you play football, rugby, or golf; to get the ball to where you want it go to, the initial direction and speed ($dy/dt$) with which it is hit clearly matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage of integration leaves us with one constant of integration and an equation in $dy/dt$ and therefore $dy/dt$ is needed at $t_0$ to find this constant. Integrating this equation produces a second constant; hence, two initial conditions are needed. In any initial value problem once the calculation is started, there is no telling what value $y$ will have since only the initial value has been fixed. Because many potential initial conditions could apply, all trajectories could start at $t_0$, and have different $y(t_0)$ and gradients or start at different $t_0$ with the same gradient and so forth. These different starting conditions generate a _field_ or _swarm_ of solutions, or trajectories, Fig. 1. Solutions are sometimes represented on a graph by sets of arrows to indicate trends at different places and these are drawn as well as a particular solution.\n",

    "The boundary value problem defines conditions at two places that have to be satisfied throughout the calculation, thereby constraining the solutions. The most familiar example is probably the Schroedinger equation describing the quantum mechanical particle in an infinitely high box. This is solved with boundary conditions that the wavefunction must always be zero at both sides of the box, because if this were not the case an infinite amount of energy would be needed. \n",

    "The rate of a chemical reaction can always be written down because this is proportional to the rate of loss or gain of a molecule's population.

This is of great utility because the complete solution can be very complex and often only numerical solutions are available.

    "The steady state is found when the gradient is zero, i.e. $dy/dx = 0$. In non-linear differential equations which have higher powers of $x$, such as $dy/dx = x + ax^2 + bx^3$, there are many 'steady states', which are also called *critical, fixed*, or *equilibrium points*, and it is now useful to see where these are by plotting $dy/dx$ vs. $x$. This graph is called the *phase portrait*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The new feature is that some equilibrium points are stable and others not. If an initial value of $x$ is chosen close to a stable equilibrium point, conditions will change as $x$ changes so that this point will be reached; if it is an unstable point, conditions now change so that this point is avoided. This may or may not mean that another stable point will be found,see Figure 2, which shows a schematic phase portrait. Some steady state points therefore can also be called equilibrium points because once the system reaches one of these it will remain there. \n",

    "In Fig. 2 the arrows indicate the direction $x$ will follow depending on its initial value; for example if 3 $\\le$ x $\\lt$ 2, then $x$ will move towards, and end at, the stable point $x$ = 3. The rule of thumb is that if the curve is above the $x$-axis the arrows move to the right, and they move to the left if the curve is below the line. A point starting in the range $0\\to 1$ or $1\\to 2$ moves to the stable point 1, and point 2 is unstable. Starting in the range $\\gt 2$, moves to stable point $3$, but starting at zero or any negative value is unstable. A negative value of $d^2y/dx^2$ at a steady state point also indicates stability.\n",

    "\n",
    "A laser has two basic forms, an amplifier and an oscillator. A laser amplifier is usually a single or double pass device in which an input laser is amplified by spontaneous emission in the gain material in which there is a population inversion. If the gain material contains atoms, ions, or molecules this inversion contains many more excited states than ground states and an incoming photon of the correct energy will stimulate an excited state to enter a lower state by releasing its energy as a new photon. The population of this lower state has to be kept close to zero if the laser is to work well, because the transition rate is proportional to the population difference. The initial inversion is produced by an external source, for example, by using another laser, flash lamps, or an electric current. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a laser oscillator, the gain material is placed between mirrors so that feedback of photons between these is possible. The lasing builds up to a steady state because a little of the spontaneous emission from the population inversion is captured by the mirrors and repeatedly passes back and forth through the gain material causing each photon to stimulate another every time it does so. The process is therefore non-linear. If you have tried to align a laser, you will have noticed that as soon as the alignment is correct, and the losses are therefore drastically reduced, the laser instantly lights up. A steady state is reached because there are losses in the cavity as well as gain and these balance one another.\n",

    "\n",
    "A basic model of a laser measures the rate of change of the number of photons $dn/dt$ as the difference between the number due to gain and loss and, clearly, if the laser is to work the gain must initially exceed the loss. The threshold to lasing occurs when gain equals loss, (see Haken 1978, p. 127; and Svelto 1982). The increase or gain in the number of photons is due to _stimulated emission_. The losses are caused by reflections from surfaces in the laser cavity, such as those on the laser rod or the quartz of a dye cell, and from transmission through the output-coupling mirror. Some gain materials also absorb at the same wavelength as the laser operates, and this is a cause of loss. The gain minus loss in the number of photons is therefore\n",

    "\n",
    "where $g$ represents the gain coefficient, $N$ the number of excited states in the gain medium, which assumes that the lower state has zero population. The rate constant for decay of photons out of the cavity $k$ accounts for all the losses. This equation is non-linear although it appears not to be. The non-linearity is introduced because the number of excited states $N$ is not expected to be constant since photons are stimulated out of it. Suppose, therefore, that by continuous external excitation, the number of excited states is kept constant at $N_0$, then $N = N_0 - \\gamma n$ where $\\gamma$ is a constant. The rate equation now becomes non-linear; \n",

    "\n",
    "If the excitation producing the excited states is weak, then $a$ is negative and the number of photons does not increase. The lasing threshold condition occurs when $a = 0$ giving the minimum $N_0$ as $k/g$. Thus, if the laser gain coefficient $g$ is high, the lasing threshold is small. If the rate of loss of photons in the cavity $k$ is small, which corresponds to a long cavity lifetime, the threshold is also small. If excitation is strong, making $N_0$ large, then $a$ is positive and the laser operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase portrait $dn/dt$ vs. $n$ is now an inverted curve as $a \\gt 0$ and has steady states at $n_{ss} = 0$ and at $n_{ss} = \\alpha/\\beta$. Since the rate of change of the number of photons has to be positive for the laser to work, the gradient at threshold must be negative; see Fig. 3. The second derivative at threshold is $-a$, which is negative, and confirms the stability as $a$ is positive. The presence of the steady state means that the laser intensity will rise to a constant value, given by the pump intensity. When this is achieved, the gain must balance the loss because the rate of change of the number of photons is zero. Note that loss includes the number of photons that form the laser beam itself.\n",

    "The following example describes ice forming on a still lake. The ice layer increases in thickness with the square root of time when the water temperature is $0^\\mathrm{o}$ C and the air temperature is lower and constant. The ice acts to insulate the water from the colder air above. A quantity of heat, $dH$, is taken from the water to freeze it in time $dt$, and the rate of heat transfer is $dH/dt$. By Fourier's law, equation (8) this is proportional to the temperature gradient $\\Delta \\theta/x $ across the ice, therefore $dH/dt \\propto \\Delta\\theta/x$. As the ice thickens, the temperature gradient decreases and so heat transfer is reduced per unit time, which must be proportional to the thickness $dH \\propto dx$, hence $dx/dt = \\alpha\\Delta\\theta/x$ where $\\alpha$ is a constant of proportionality. When integrated, this equation shows that the ice thickness increases as the square root of time; $x \\propto \\sqrt{t}$. This, and the fact that ice is less dense that water means that lakes do not generally freeze solid; there are usually not enough cold days.\n",

    "An interesting consequence concerns the freezing of water droplets in the atmosphere. Non-linear freezing means that the outside of the liquid droplet freezes rapidly, forming a shell. This may become strained as it thickens, causing the ice to crack thus releasing a spurt of liquid water from the interior in the form of micro-droplets, which rapidly freeze in the cold air. Such a process may be important in cloud formation.\n",

If two gases are in the pipe, the ratio of the amount of each transported outside is in the ratio of their diffusion coefficients and their concentrations.

This can be the case for O$_2$ diffusing into a cell, or the reaction of ATP molecules when their concentration is high enough. ATP is used by the molecular motor protein ATPase. In this protein, proton flow across a membrane containing the ATPase drives a rotor that then forces closed one part of the protein and thereby splits ATP to ADP and releases phosphate. The reverse reaction can occur depending on the prevailing conditions. ATP is also used to drive similar molecular motors to ATPase that operate the flagellum of a micro-organism and so enable it to move. In this case, the ATP has to diffuse down the flagellum from its base where it has a constant concentration. The possibility exists that diffusion cannot supply enough ATP molecules, and hence energy, to move the flagellum and using the diffusion equation this condition is sought. The general model is therefore of a fixed concentration $c_0$ of a species outside a boundary, which diffuses (in one dimension in this model) into the bulk where it also reacts. We want to know to how far into the bulk reaction can occur.\n",

Using typical values, reaction can only take place within $10$ microns at most from the boundary. More sophisticated reactions with, say, spherical geometry lead to similar conclusions. Thus, it is understandable why small insects, for example, have tracheal tubes to increase the O$_2$ available to diffuse into their muscles and so maintain the high metabolic rate necessary for flight.\n",

    "The time taken to cool a cup of coffee or tea follows Newton's law of cooling. This law states that the _rate_ of cooling depends on the difference in temperature compared to the surroundings and the form that the rate of heat transferred from one body is the same as that gained by another. This means that the rate is proportional to the temperature difference or\n",

When divided by the surface area, this is sometimes called Newton's cooling coefficient with units of watts $\\mathrm{m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}$. The cooling equation assumes that the cooling is convective and the object is in a slight draught of air so that the air temperature next to the object $\\theta_s$ is constant. If the draught becomes a forced flow of air, then the cooling coefficient becomes dependent on the air speed and a 'wind chill' effect occurs. This is soon felt if you are outside on a cool day and move into a strong wind from a sheltered spot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Newton's law of cooling has the same form as a first-order rate equation. The rate of change of temperature is proportional to the temperature of the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mammals cool themselves by evaporating water from their bodies, by sweating or panting. The heat balance equation must, therefore, have extra positive terms due to the chemical reactions keeping them alive (their metabolism) and negative terms due to evaporation. This last term could be incorporated into the constant $k$. Heat flow is also important in simple chemical reactions and exothermic reactions are usually cooled. If the heat loss from the reaction vessel is not sufficient, the heat generated by an exothermic reaction, such as fermentation, can result in spontaneous combustion as used to happen with hayricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In radical polymerization reactions, as the reaction proceeds towards completion, the mixture must become very viscous. This means that the termination steps cannot occur and the rate of reaction increases because this is inversely proportional to the rate of termination. Secondly, the increased viscosity means that stirring can become ineffective and the only cooling mechanism is thus thermal diffusion to the vessel walls, which is slow. Consequently, if heat gain is too great, any gases or vapours trapped in the polymer may cause it to explode. This is called the *Trommsdorff - Norrish* effect and is an example of an auto-acceleration process or one with positive feedback. The rate of temperature change has an extra term for the heat generated and should have the generic form \n",

The beam of X-rays has intensity $I$, and if a sample contains $n$ electrons per unit volume, the first layer of thickness $dL$ intercepts $ndL$ photons, each electron presenting an area of $4\\pi d^2$ where $d = e^2/mc^2$ and is approximately the closest approach distance of two electrons.
