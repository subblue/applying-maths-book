<h2>Motivation and concept<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation-and-concept" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The fourier transform can be extended to 2D and 3D. The 2D transform is important in image analysis, optics and 2D spectroscopies such as ultrafast infra-red and nmr analysis. The 3D transform is used to describe x-ray diffraction from crystals which is the definitive way of determining molecular structure and is of central importance in chemistry and biochemistry. We shall illustrate how x-ray diffraction leads to structure using 2D fourier transforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="d-transforms">
<h2>12. 2D transforms.<a class="headerlink" href="#d-transforms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The 2D forward and inverse transform is written down easily by analogy with the 1D versions, but rather than use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_x,k_y\)</span> for the conjugate variables it is clearer instead to use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u,v\)</span></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle g(u,v)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x,y)e^{-i(xu+yv)}dxdy\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle f(x,y)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(u,v)e^{+i(xu+yv)}dudv\tag{49}\]</div>
<p>and, clearly, if the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x,y)\)</span> can be written as the product <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)f(y)\)</span>, which means no terms such as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(xy\)</span> are present then the 2D transform is the product of 1D ones, which is a great simplification,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle g(u,v)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)e^{-ixu}dx\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(y)e^{-iyv}dy\tag{50}\]</div>
<p>The symmetry properties of the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> are important and show themselves clearly in the transform, which is most easily viewed as an image. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x,y)\)</span> is real, which it will be in an experiment, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g(u,v)=g^{*}(-u,-v)\)</span> and then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|g(u,v|^2\)</span> is centrosymmetric, i.e. has a centre of inversion. If the function does not change after rotation about the origin by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((360/n)^\text{o}\)</span>, i.e. is indistinguishable after <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>-fold rotation, then the transform behaves similarly. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> is real and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is odd then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|g(u,v|^2\)</span> has <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>-fold symmetry but is also centrosymmetric so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2n\)</span>-fold symmetry is apparent in the transform, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5\)</span>-fold symmetry appears as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\)</span>-fold, see figure 63. Mirror planes behave similarly, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x,y)=\pm f(-x,y)\)</span> produce <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g(-u,v)=\pm g(u,v)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|g(u,v|^2\)</span> has mirror plane symmetry. Besides these symmetry properties the basic inverse relationship between a function and its transform still exists, but now in both <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>, i.e. the further apart the features in the function are the closer they will be in the transform and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>
<p>The first image below is that of two point sources and results in a cosine shaped image as the transform of two delta functions is a cosine. A cut through the image along the direction of the two points would produce a cosine, although the way the colour is presented in the image distorts ones perception of this. The four-fold image shows the same effect but now in two directions producing a transform of squares rather than lines. The blue part of the image has the greatest intensity, the red the least. The three-, five- and seven-fold points produce double the symmetry due to the transform being centrosymmetric. As a technical aside, when calculating the transforms the images have to be centralised before they have the appearance shown. Python/numpy has a function to do this. If the numpy library is called <em>np</em> then the transform of a 2D array called <em>image</em> is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathtt{g2D = np.fft.fft2(image)}\)</span> and to centralise the transform <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathtt{FTimage = np.fft.fftshift(g2D)}\)</span>. Plotting can be done using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathtt{plt.imshow(FTimage)}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Figure 63. The absolute values of the fourier transforms of the point images shown in the inset to each figure for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2,3,4,5,6, 7\)</span> fold rotational symmetry. The doubling of the symmetry when there is an odd number of points is clear as are the mirror planes. The points are rotated slightly from vertical to show that the transform follows the orientation of these points. A grid of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{10}\times 2^{10}\)</span> points was used to make the transform. Blue is the most intense, dark red the least.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The 1D transform of a single ‘top hat’ or rectangular shape is the sinc function, see fig 15 earlier in the chapter. In two dimensions the ‘top hat’ function in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> becomes a slit, of infinite length in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> direction, or a rectangular hole if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> is of finite length.  Light passes through the slit will be diffracted, (Franhofer diffraction), and its intensity is described by the absolute value of the fourier transform. These transforms can be observed experimentally using a laser pointer or collimated light from a LED with masks cut with rectangular or circular apertures or as pinholes representing a molecule’s atoms or even a lattice of pinholes. When the light is projected onto a screen the transform should be apparent. The size of the apertures relative to laser wavelength need to be considered to optimise the effects. The transform can also be calculated as illustrated below.</p>
<p>The transform of the slit of width <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> if the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 1,  &amp; |x|\le a/2 \\
0, &amp;|x|\gt a/2  \end{cases}\)</span></p>
<p>and is infinitely long in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> direction, as is shown by the limits,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\displaystyle \begin{align} g(u,v)&amp;=\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} e^{-ixu}dx \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-iyv}dy\\
&amp;=\frac{2\sin(au/2)}{u}\delta(v) = a\;\text{sinc}(au/2)\delta(v)\end{align}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>and along the axis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v=0\)</span> and therefore the delta function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta(v)=1\)</span> and the diffracted light has intensity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|g(u,v)|^2=a^2\text{sinc}(au/2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If there is a rectangular hole of size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a x b\)</span> then the similar calculation uses both finite limits and is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\displaystyle \begin{align} g(u,v)&amp;=\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} e^{-ixu}dx \int_{-b/2}^
{b/2} e^{-iyv}dy\\ &amp;=\frac{2\sin(au/2)}{u}\frac{2\sin(bv/2)}{v}\\&amp;= ab\;\text{sinc}(au/2)\text{sinc}(bv/2)\end{align}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>which are two sinc functions at right-angles to one another. The image is shown in fig 64. If diffraction occurred through such an aperture the absolute value would be obtained because detectors (and our eyes) measure the intensity which is the square of the light’s amplitude. The image would look similar except that all the function would be positive rather than both positive and negative. Notice the similarity of this to the transform of four points arranged in a square, fig 63, (ignoring the rotation of the latter). The difference in the transforms occurs because when more than one object is present a cosine along each symmetry axis is also present. This may be understood as the image of two or more delta functions convoluted with the shape of the object itself; when more than one object is transformed the transform spreads out over transform space.</p>

The transform of a rectangular aperture. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\displaystyle g(u,v)=4\sin(au/2)\sin(bv/2)/uv\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b/a=2\)</span> The dotted lines show the negative part of the transform. Yellow represents large values. The straight horizontal and vertical lines are where the transform is exactly zero and shows that the image is dissected by the zero’s of the function in both vertical and horizontal directions. The vertical lines are separated horizontally by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi/a\)</span>, the horizontal by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi/b\)</span> except for the centres which are separated by twice these amounts. A horizontal or vertical cut through the centre lines will produce a plot of the sinc function as in figure 15.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The transform of annular aperture (ring) and of a disc shaped aperture can be calculated in a related way by using polar coordinates, which is far more convenient because of the radial symmetry. The transform for a ring is in terms of a Bessel function and for a disc is an Airy function, both of which are integrals that oscillate rather as the sinc function does. The transforms for one and two discs is shown, as their absolute value, in figure 65. These results are calculated using the numerical FFT. The diffraction pattern has the symmetry of the circle with ever increasing waves radiating outwards. The right-hand figure shows two discs separated by a small amount, here the transform looks like that of two points (a cosine) convoluted with a disc, i.e a cosine superimposed on expanding circles. The cosine rises and falls along the direction of centres of the two discs. The closer the two discs are the further apart the features in the transform due to the reciprocal nature of the variables in real space (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x,y\)</span>) and conjugate or transform space (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u,v\)</span>).</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing" src="../_images/fourier-fig65.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 65, Left. Single disc and its transform (as absolute value) shown as an image. Right. Two discs showing the effect of two points convoluted with a disc. The disc’s transform is divided up by a cosine. If the separation of the discs is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> pixels the fringes are separated by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/d\)</span> which in this figure is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^N/d\)</span> pixels for an image of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\times N\)</span> pixels.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The similar effect can be seen in fig 66 where four squares are displaced just as in the top right image of fig 0, but in fig 66 the objects have vertical and horizontal sides. This extra symmetry is imposed on the diagonal cosine lines lines shown in figure 63 as extra vertical and horizontal features, just as in figure 64. Furthermore, the size of the squares is smaller than their separation so that the extra lines in fig 66 compared to 65 are further apart than the pattern due to the the centres of the squares themselves. This is because of the reciprocal relationship of the transform from ‘real space’ to ‘transform space’ or from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> the conjugate variables.</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing" src="../_images/fourier-fig66.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 66. Absolute value of the fourier transform of the four squares shown in the inset. Compared to the top right image of figure 65, the extra symmetry of the vertical and horizontal lines is apparent and similar to that in figure 64. The image area shown is 9 times than that in 65 and the colour range has been exaggerated/saturated to show the detail. Blue is the highest, red the lowest intensity.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Similar effects are seen with lines and zig-zags as shown in the next figure, fig 66a. A single line is transformed into a line but in the conjugate orientation, fig 66a left, with two parallel lines the same feature is observed but now split by the reciprocal of the separation of the lines. Thus the larger the separation the closer together the transformed interference fringes become, (middle figure). On the right two sets of parallel lines for a zig-zag and the image is that of the parallel lines in each direction. The X or cross pattern is characteristic of a zig-zag and a helix and was essential for unravelling the structure of DNA as explained below, section 13.10.</p>

<p>In figure 63 the transform of some regular patterns was calculated and with an irregular pattern, such as the arrangement of atoms in many molecules, related result is produced. Figure 67 shows the transform of the pattern shown in the inset. There are similarities with the patterns of fig 63, but the lower symmetry restricts the symmetry of the transform.</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing" src="../_images/fourier-fig67.png" /></p>

<p>The fourier transform of a lattice of points is also a lattice but now in transform space. The 2D lattice, fig D10, has a minimum repeating shape with lengths of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = 70\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( b = 120\)</span> set at an angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma=80^\text{o}\)</span>. The fourier transform is also a grid with lengths <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a^*,b^*\)</span> of</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \displaystyle a^*=\frac{1}{a\sin(\gamma)},\; b^*=\frac{1}{b\sin(\gamma)}\]</div>
<p>but because we have used a grid to do the transform, i.e. sampled the lattice by making a 2D grid, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a,b\)</span> values must be multiplied by the grid size, in this case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{12}\)</span>. In fig 63 the top right-hand image shows the absolute value of the transform of just four points set as a square. In the grid of fig 68 there are numerous groups of four points and so the transform becomes more like a set of point functions just. This is similar to what happens in one dimension where several wide top-hat function produce a set of narrow transforms and an infinite number eventually a comb of delta functions.</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing" src="../_images/fourier-fig68.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 68. A 2D lattice and the absolute value of its fourier transform. Notice how the image is rotated and the lengths between points are related as reciprocals.

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>If each point is now ‘decorated’ to form a pattern as in fig 69, i.e. to make a 2D lattice of ‘molecules’, the transform’s pattern is just the same as that consisting only of points, fig 68. This may seem surprising. The  positions in the transform are unchanged, compared to a plain lattice, due to the regular or repetitive nature of the points, but their relative intensity is modulated. The key point is that it is the <em>intensity</em> of each spot that provides the information about the structure of the original image, not the position of the spots in the transform, which gives only the spacing of the repeated pattern.  The various intensities in the transform is due to the fact that interference from different atoms occurs in a manner depending only on their relative positions.</p>
<p>The image of molecules on a lattice, the transform and the transform with the superimposed transform of a single molecule is shown in fig 69. We can think of the transform as the convolution of a single molecule with a lattice of points.</p>

<h2>13.1 Diffraction of x-rays<a class="headerlink" href="#diffraction-of-x-rays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The structure of a molecule can be determined by detecting the x-rays diffracted by its crystal. The experiment consists of diffraction, detection and computational analysis which combined act as if a microscope was used. The explanation of how this works has two parts: (1) how is magnification achieved and (2) how does the measured data lead to the structure. The first part is quite straightforward, the second more involved.</p>
<div class="section" id="magnification">
<h3><strong>Magnification</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#magnification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The magnification can be explained by reference to Huygens’ wavelets as in figure 70a. A plane wave arrives at the bottom of the figure and is diffracted by two slits shown as red dots, alternatively these represent sources in their own right, for example two atoms whose electrons re-radiate x-rays. By calculating where the circular wavelets overlap the position of the bright fringes on a detector can be predicted. To be accurate this has to be done in the ‘far field’, i.e. at a very great distance from the source of diffraction. Alternatively, by assuming that the path lengths are different by integer numbers of wavelengths produces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\lambda = d \sin(\theta)\)</span>  where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> is the separation of the sources, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> the wavelength and the integers are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=0,\pm 1,\pm 2\cdots \)</span>. The angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> can be obtained from the experiment, as shown in the figure where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tan(\theta)=(d/2+x)/R\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x,R\)</span> are measurements. These values are generally many centimetres where as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d,\lambda \)</span> are millions of times smaller. This is made clearer when the angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is small, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tan(\theta)\approx \sin(\theta) \approx \theta \)</span> making <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\displaystyle \frac{x}{R} =\frac{n\lambda}{d}\)</span> and as these are ratios the orders of magnitude difference in size cancel out and once <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> is known so is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p>The deflection caused by diffraction is crucial here for this separates the diffracted beam from the initial one allowing it to be detected against a dark (zero) background and secondly the fact that the angle of detection depends on the separation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> means that many distances can be separately measured without overlapping one another. The ratio of distances automatically enables magnification once the beams have propagated far enough to allow accurate measurement of diffracted spot positions.</p>

<h3><strong>Structure</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before we can find the cell dimensions it is necessary to understand how the x-rays are diffracted off the repeated and regular structure of the crystal. Diffraction of x-rays occurs by interaction of the electrons with the x-rays which then re-radiate in all directions. Only those directions satisfying conservation of momentum produce a diffracted beam that can be recorded as a bright spot on a detector. This means the only waves detected are those whose path-length differs by an integer number of wavelengths and therefore add constructively and re-enforce one another, all other waves cancel to zero. The condition for diffraction is given most generally by the Laue equation or equivalently and more simply by the Bragg condition, fig. 70,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle n\lambda =2d\sin(\theta)\tag{54}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> is the <em>perpendicular</em> spacing between similar planes of atoms and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle the incoming x-ray makes to the plane of atoms. The diffracted beam is also at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> to the plane so the diffracted angle is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\theta\)</span> from the incoming beam. The diffraction order is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> the x-ray wavelength, for example 0.1542 nm for Cu<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K_{1\alpha}\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.178892\)</span> nm for Co<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K_{1\alpha}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As there are different orders of diffraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n = 0,\pm 1,\pm 2 \cdots\)</span> the third order reflexion from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((100)\)</span> planes, for example, can be looked at in this way or it could be a first order reflexion from the set of planes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((300)\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/3\)</span> of the spacing of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((100)\)</span> planes. Consequently we can divide by the common factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\)</span>, i.e.,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\displaystyle 3\lambda = 2 d_{100}\sin(\theta_{300}) \\ \lambda =2d_{300}\sin(\theta_{300}) \end{split}\]</div>
<p>and this latter form of the equation is usually chosen by crystallographers so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> does not appear in the Bragg equation.</p>
<p>Although the x-rays are diffracted it is usual to speak of them being ‘reflected’ from the planes of atoms because of the similarity of the geometry to that of reflection by light. Often the archaic spelling ‘reflexion’ is used and we use this also as a reminder that diffraction occurs. Figure 70 shows (images A and B) the Bragg arrangement for scattering off planes containing atoms. The path-length of the diffracted rays must be integer multiples of one another and this is only achieved at a fixed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{hkl}\)</span> at a certain angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>. Figures (C) and (D) show the scattering from different planes on the same lattice. Notice how the lattice has to be rotated to effect the Bragg condition for different <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h,k,l\)</span> because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> is constant and has a fixed direction in any experiment. To satisfy the Bragg condition when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{hkl}\)</span> is small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>, the diffracted angle, has to be large and <em>vice versa</em>. As the crystal is rotated only at certain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>, and hence at some <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span>, will diffraction occur, otherwise x-rays will pass through without being diffracted. The result is an image of diffracted x-ray that contains relatively few spots, even if this number is many thousands.</p>
<p>It is clear from fig 70 and 71 that at large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h,k,l,\;d_{hkl}\)</span> is small and the diffracted angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is large. Using a tetragonal crystal as an example, the larger the Miller indices (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span>) become the smaller the separation of the planes since</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle d_{hkl}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{h^2/a^2+k^2/b^2+l^2/c^2}}\qquad \text{tetragonal crystal  } a=b \neq c \text{, all angles } 90^\text{o}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a=b\ne c\)</span> give the length of the unit cell’s sides. The smaller the values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{hkl}\)</span> or the larger the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((hkl)\)</span> the more detail the diffracted image of the crystal contains. In other words, as is expected for the conjugate relationship between fourier variables, small separation of lattice planes means spots at large distance from the origin in the diffracted image. This means that for fine resolution of a molecular structure accurate measurement of points at the periphery of an image is vitally important.</p>

<h2>13.2 Fourier Synthesis<a class="headerlink" href="#fourier-synthesis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The transform of several images has been described but these only become properly interesting when considered in the context of x-ray diffraction from crystals. The nature of x-ray diffraction is discussed shortly as is the connection between the crystal structure, the experimentally measured fourier transform and the fourier <em>synthesis</em> of the structure. To do this we shall have to understand the scattering of x-rays by the electrons in the planes of atoms that exist in a (perfect) crystal because of the repetitive nature of each atom’s position. The approach so far has been to start off with a lattice of points as in fig 68, or 69 and form the diffraction pattern, which is the fourier transform, but in an experiment things are the other way round, the data is the diffraction pattern and we want to know each atom’s position. The use of fast computers and new algorithms nowadays make most of the analysis automatic, nevertheless the fundamentals must be understood otherwise how would one know if the results of automatic analysis make sense?</p>
<p>The experimental data available is the position and intensity of the spots on the diffraction image. Because all detectors measure the intensity of the x-ray, which is its amplitude squared, and not its amplitude which is proportional to the electron density of an atom, the image cannot be directly transformed back into a structure. However, there is also an excess of information, for example, a molecule consisting of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\)</span> atoms needs <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30\)</span> values to determine its coordinates but there may be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=1000\)</span> or so reflexions recorded so that there will be many redundant observations which can also be used. The problem is therefore given the intensities, how can we work backwards and determine the atomic coordinates? Bragg proposed a method, which is to let the intensities be found by a fourier <em>series</em>, this process is called fourier <em>synthesis</em> (section 1.1) rather than the fourier <em>analysis</em> described in section 6. Variants of fourier synthesis form the basis of almost all crystal structure determinations.</p>
<p>The equation for fourier synthesis in one dimension is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle F(x)=A_0+A_1\cos\big(2\pi (x/a+\varphi_1)\big)+A_2\cos\big(2\pi (2x/a+\varphi_2)\big) +\cdots\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle =\sum_{n=0}^\infty A_n\cos\big(2\pi (nx/a+\varphi_n)\big) \tag{51}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> is the repeat distance, i.e. the length of one side of the unit cell, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi\)</span> the phase and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> the amplitude which ultimately depends on the type of atom. The greater the number electrons an atom has, the greater the scattering. The phase depends on how far an atom is from the origin of the unit cell in the direction of a particular <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((hkl)\)</span> plane. This is sketched in fig 71.</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing" src="../_images/fourier-fig70.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 71. The phase of scattered x-rays is given by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi\)</span> times the ratio of the perpendicular distance from the origin <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((0,0,0)\)</span> to an atom <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((x,y,z)\)</span> to the separation of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span> planes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{hkl}\)</span> i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi=-2\pi R/d_{hkl}\)</span>. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span> plane is perpendicular to the plane of the diagram.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In three dimensions the same form of equation is found, now with directions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x,y,z\)</span>, summation with the integers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h,k,l\)</span> and with unit cell dimensions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a,b,c\)</span>. The property measured is the electron density <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span>, which has units of number of electrons/nm<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^3\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle \rho(x,y,z)=\sum_{h=-\infty}^\infty\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty\sum_{l=-\infty}^\infty A_{hkl}\cos\big(2\pi (hx/a+ky/b+lz/c)\big) \tag{52}\]</div>
<p>which can also be put into the more general exponential form</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle \rho(x,y,z)=V^{-1}\sum_{h=-\infty}^\infty\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty\sum_{l=-\infty}^\infty F_{hkl}\exp\big(-2\pi i( hx/a+ky/b+lz/c)\big) \tag{53}\]</div>
<p>The amplitudes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{hkl}\)</span> are related to the structure factors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span>, described shortly, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{hkl}=F_{hkl}/V\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> is the volume of the unit cell. The structure factors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span> are functions of the unit cell dimensions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a,b,c\)</span>, the atom’s position e.g. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_j,y_j,z_j\)</span> for atom <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> at each reflection plane <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h,k,l\)</span> whereas in eqn. 53 the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x,y,z\)</span> are any coordinates in the unit cell used locate the electron density. Normally the unit cell <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x/a,y/b,z/c\)</span> would be split in to a grid of, say, 25 points in each direction.</p>
<p>Equation 53 also shows how the electron density and structure factors are related as a fourier transform pair. The electron density is used to locate the atoms, large at an atom but small otherwise.</p>
<p>Often the atom coordinates are given as fractions of the unit cell dimensions, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x/a\)</span> instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> etc. and then eqn. 53 becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle \rho(x,y,z)=V^{-1}\sum_{h=-\infty}^\infty\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty\sum_{l=-\infty}^\infty F_{hkl}\exp\big(-2\pi i( hx+ky+lz)\big) \tag{53'}\]</div>
<p>so it is important to check what convention is used. Some authors also prefer to use vector notation so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hx+ky+lz\equiv \vec H \cdot \vec X\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec H=[h,k,l],\; \vec X=[x,y,z]\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec H \cdot \vec X\)</span> is the dot product.</p>
<p>It is clear that to be able to calculate this series the unit cell dimensions (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a,b,c)\)</span> have to be found as well as the structure factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span>, and that is all that is necessary to determine the structure. In evaluating the series the electron density will rise at the position of an atom and fall, effectively to zero, between atoms giving a 3D picture of the atoms.  In theory an infinite number of structure factors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span> are necessary in eqn. 53, but naturally we only have a finite number of diffraction spots and so some error is introduced into each atom’s position, but these are not too serious in x-ray diffraction because there is a fall-off in scattering intensity with Bragg angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> so that the structure factors get smaller as this angle increases. Consequently the series converges which is the next best thing to an infinite one.</p>
<p>All detectors measure the square of the absolute value of the structure factor, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|F_{hkl}|^2\)</span> thus only its positive magnitude is known, which is a serious problem because the structure factor can be positive, negative or complex. Because only the absolute values is measured leads to what is called the <em>phase problem</em> and is a significant obstacle in structure determination. No one has yet discovered how to measure the x-ray amplitude instead of the intensity and so a fourier synthesis has to be used, i.e. constructing the electron density by choosing, by non-linear, least-squares or other methods, various <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span> until the data is fitted. This sounds quite simple but as we shall see the overall sign and magnitude of the calculated <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> depends on each atom’s position in the unit cell.</p>
<p>If the electron density is fourier transformed the structure factor is produced and because of the complex exponential terms this is also a complex number. Without going into details this can be therefore represented in the usual way as a real and ‘imaginary’ term</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle F(h,k,l) =A(h,k,l)+iB(h,k,l) \]</div>
<p>The absolute value squared is then</p>

<h2>13.3 Unit Cell, Miller indices and planes of atoms<a class="headerlink" href="#unit-cell-miller-indices-and-planes-of-atoms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The convention in describing crystals is that a <em>crystal structure</em> consists of atoms, a <em>crystal lattice</em> consists of points, and a <em>crystal system</em> consists of axes usually described by vectors. In a crystal the <em>unit cell</em> represents a repeated structure containing the atoms positions and is described by vectors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar a,\bar b, \bar c\)</span>, which need not be at right angles to one another. The unit cell is normally taken to have the minimum size needed to describe the repeating nature of the atoms. If a point in the unit cell is chosen to be the origin, a corner for example, this single position, when repeated over and over in the crystal, forms a lattice of points as in Fig 68. This lattice will belong to one of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7\)</span> crystal systems and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(14\)</span> Bravais lattices. The origin does not have to be the position of an atom but often is. The other atoms then form a similar lattice but displaced in a manner described by the atom’s position relative to the origin, this is equivalent to imagining that the whole unit cell is replicated again and again to form the crystal.</p>
<p>The 3D lattice based on the atom at the origin is then imagined to be divided into stacks of similar planes of atoms all in the same position relative in their unit cell, see fig 72. These planes (shown edge-on as lines in fig 72) are given indices (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h k l\)</span>) which are called Miller Indices where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h,k,l\)</span> are positive or negative integers including zero. Although there are numerous parallel planes we refer to them collectively using only their unique <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h,k,l\)</span> values such as (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\;14\;\bar 1\)</span>), where the bar indicates a negative direction.  Via the Bragg diffraction equation (eqn. D4) each set of planes, and thus each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span>, produce one bright spot on the detector.</p>
<p>To work out the Miller indices for any set of planes start by moving along the unit cell in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar a\)</span> direction and count how many pieces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> is divided into by the planes, i.e. the number of spaces crossed, then repeat this for sides <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span>, the integers produced are the Miller indices.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>An alternative way to find the Miller indices is to look along the edges of the unit cell and count how many unit cells it takes to meet the line whose <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((hkl)\)</span> is required. These three numbers are then listed, e.g. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((3a,\infty b,2c)\)</span>.

<h2>13.4 Calculating the unit cell and indexing<a class="headerlink" href="#calculating-the-unit-cell-and-indexing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The unit cell dimensions can often be found using power diffraction, and you will probably have done such an experiment in a practical course. In this method the crystals are crushed and placed into a narrow glass capillary tube which is placed in the centre of the instrument. The detector moves in an arc round the sample and the diffracted x-ray  are recorded as a function of the angle. This arrangement is called a Debye - Scherrer camera. In the past the detector was a strip of photographic film that was darkened by the x-rays and older textbook show the images produced as arcs on this paper. Nowadays a particle counting or imaging detector is used but in either case a plot of angle vs. intensity is produced. The crystals are at random angles (in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span>) but by Bragg’s law the diffraction can occur only at certain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> angles of the planes of atoms to the x-ray beam (see fig72(A) but those planes can be anywhere around the x-ray beam at an angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span>, i.e. there is cylindrical symmetry. Different <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span> planes diffract at different angles and so several cones are produced, see fig 73. As there are numerous crystals, all angles <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> around the x-ray beam direction (at a given <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\theta\)</span> ) will diffract and so the all cones will have many photons.  The detector will intercept only a few of these as it moves in an arc, see fig 74, and produce a series of lines with a characteristic pattern.</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing" src="../_images/fourier-fig73.png" /></p>
<p>Fig. 73. The powdered crystals have random orientations (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span>) and diffract along cones. The dots show that if there are just a few crystals only a few spots would be produced.</p>

<p>The pattern in fig 75 corresponds to that of a cubic crystal of side <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> and combining the Bragg law and the inter-planar distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{hkl}\)</span> gives</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>by using the formula above with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a=b=c\)</span>. The pattern of lines, starting at the right (ignoring the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(180^\text{o}\)</span>) and moving left shows six more or less equally spaced lines the a gap before the seventh line. The Miller indices <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((hkl)\)</span> are, from the right, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100,110,111,200,210,211,220\cdots \)</span> corresponding to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h^2+k^2+l^2= 1,2,3,5,5,6,8\cdots\)</span>. There is no line when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h^2+k^2+l^2 =7\)</span> (or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(15\)</span>) as this number cannot be made with integers, hence the gap in the pattern which characteristic of a simple cubic crystal. Face-centred and body-centred also have characteristic patterns with the restrictions that for fcc., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span> are all odd or all even, and for bcc., <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h+k+l\)</span> must be even and so if plotted <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> has to follow these particular rules.</p>
<p>Once the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is measured a simple way of estimating <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\lambda/2a)^2\)</span> is to plot <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sin^2(\theta)\)</span> vs. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is a sequence of integers and look for the points where the values cross by drawing horizontal and vertical lines on the plot. Next draw a straight line from the origin with guessed gradients until this line crosses each the other two. It is simpler than it sounds and is shown in fig76. Once the values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\equiv h^2+k^2+l^2\)</span> are known a least squares can be used to improve the fit.</p>

<h2>13.5 Atomic Structure Factors<a class="headerlink" href="#atomic-structure-factors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As the x-rays scatter off the electrons in an atom, clearly the more electrons there are the greater the scattering will be. Thus we expect, and observe, that heavy atoms produce much more intense bright spots on a detector than do lighter atoms. However, atoms are not point objects but have a real size with an electron ‘cloud’ radius that is only a little smaller than a bond length. Electron density is greater towards the atom’s centre and less towards the perimeter.</p>
<p>Assuming a largely spherical electron distribution, when x-rays are scattered and detected at an angle away from incoming the x-ray’s direction, there will be a path-length difference between one side of the atom and the other and this leads to scattered waves becoming out of phase, and hence of reduced intensity and increasingly so as the scattering angle increases. As the atoms in a molecule are always close to one another, so are electrons on different atoms and this proximity potentially leads to a great computational complication. However, this is easily overcome by assuming that atoms are point objects and using a function, the <em>atomic scattering factor</em>, on each atom to allow for the scattering from its different parts. The atomic scattering factor is a decaying function of the scattering angle. At zero angle it is the atomic number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z\)</span> (plus or minus the number of charges for ions) and decreases to a constant value in terms of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sin(\theta)\lambda=1/(2d_{hkl})\)</span>.  The scattering factor can be accurately calculated using quantum chemistry methods, Hartree-Fock for example, and in some cases measured, and are known accurately. The calculated function can conveniently be described by the sum of four Gaussians, e.g.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle f_{q}= \sum_i^4 a_i e^{\large -b_i\left(q/4\pi\right)^2}+c,\qquad q=\sin(\theta)/\lambda=1/2d_{hkl}\tag{55}\]</div>
<p>with constants <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> tabulated for each atom and its ions. Later on, clarity, we label the atomic scattering factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_j^{hkl}\)</span> for atom <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> and Miller indices <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({hkl}\)</span>.

<h2>13.6 Fourier Synthesis<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To illustrate how fourier synthesis can work, suppose that there is a ‘crystal’ of only three diatomic molecules. Adding waves of different random frequencies but the same phase as shown in figure 1 of this chapter will always produce a complicated and repeating wave. By adding waves of <em>different amplitude</em>, <em>frequency</em> and <em>phase</em> it is possible to construct a total wave that is localised where the peaks are. Furthermore, relatively few waves are needed as shown in fig. 78. The left panel shows, at the top, the three molecules positioned face-on and the right-hand panel positioned edge-on, the summed wave is shown immediately below (brown) and the individual waves are numbered with their frequency. It is clear that with only a few waves their summed values can reproduce, quite well, the positions of the atoms. In an x-ray diffraction experiment the peaks would represent electron density and summing the waves is equivalent to calculating equation D1 given above.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The right hand figure shows each molecule end on so has only one peak. Combining both figures can better reproduce the molecule if plotted as contours, and such a plot is shown in fig. 79, where the location of the atoms is clear. In this calculation the amplitude and phase of the waves was chosen by trial and error until a reasonable result was produced. This is equivalent to knowing the geometric structure factors <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span> and an example of finding these is given next where the general formula is introduced.</p>

<h2>13.7   The Structure Factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#the-structure-factor-f-hkl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The structure factor, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span>, measures the size of the scattering from each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span> plane by taking into account where the atom is relative to the plane and the atomic scattering factor, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_q\)</span>, for that particular atom. To do the calculation, waves from each atom in the unit cell have to be summed as they are in superposition. The result could be zero if the total, by symmetry adds up to this or could be positive or negative. A zero result is an example of systematic absences.  In chapter 1 the superposition of cosine waves of frequency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> and phase <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi\)</span>, such as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi=a\cos(\omega t +\varphi)\)</span>, was examined. The more general wave is written as a complex exponential, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i=\sqrt{-1}\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle \psi = |a| e^{i(\omega t +\varphi)} = |a|e^{i\varphi}e^{i\omega t}=ae^{i\omega t}\]</div>
<p>where the amplitude is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a=|a|e^{i\varphi}\)</span> and as the phase varies from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\to \pi\)</span> the exponential changes from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-1\)</span>. The frequency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> is the same for all waves and can be ignored henceforth at it changes nothing.</p>
<p>The amplitude of several waves is the sum of amplitudes and becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle a_s=\sum_j^N a_j= \sum_j^N |a_j|e^{i\varphi_j} \tag{56}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle \qquad\qquad\qquad =\sum_j^N|a_j|\cos(\varphi_j)+i\sum_j^N|a_j|\sin(\varphi_j)\]</div>
<p>where De-Moivre’s theorem was used. The (square law) detector always measure the intensity not the amplitude, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_s^*a_s\)</span> and so the result of a measurement is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle I=\sum_j^N |a_j|e^{-i\varphi_j}\sum_j^N |a_i|e^{i\varphi_j}=\left(\sum_j^N|a_j|\cos(\varphi_j)\right)^2+\left(\sum_j^N|a_j|\sin(\varphi_j)\right)^2\tag{57}\]</div>
<p>In x-ray crystallography the amplitude is given by the atomic structure factor of atom <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> at each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span>,  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_j^{hkl}\)</span> and the phase <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi=2\pi(hx_j+ky_j+kz_j)\)</span>. The summation is only over the number of atoms <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> in the unit cell and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_j,y_j,z_j\)</span> are the atom coordinates as <em>fractions</em> of the unit cell dimensions.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\displaystyle F_{hkl} = \sum_j^N f_j^{hkl}e^{2\pi i(hx_j+ky_j+lz_j)}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\]</div>

\[\displaystyle \qquad\qquad\qquad =\sum_j^Nf_j^{hkl}\cos\big(2\pi(hx_j+ky_j+lz_j)\big) + i\sum_i^Nf_j^{hkl} \sin\big(2\pi(hx_j+ky_j+lz_j)\big) \tag{57}\]</div>
<p>The cosine and sine terms are sometimes called the <em>geometric structure factors</em> because they are functions of coordinates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_j,y_j,z_j\)</span> of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j^{th}\)</span> atom in the unit cell. Notice that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span> can be zero, positive, negative, real or complex.

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>and this is true for all crystals whatever their symmetry. Whenever there is a centre of symmetry, such as in Rutile (TiO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span>), the sine terms in the aggregate evaluate to zero and this is because for each angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> there is one at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\theta\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\sin(\theta)=\sin(-\theta)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The diffraction itself produces scattering of amplitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{hkl}\)</span> which brings us back to eqn 53 which shows how the electron density is related to the structure factor.  The measurement changes the data by effectively measuring the absolute value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|F_{hkl}|\)</span> and the sign of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> is therefore lost and there is no experimental method with which to determine it. Using fourier synthesis is the option mainly used, effectively guessing a structure based on starting with as much information as is available about the molecules and its crystal and proceeding by least squares type fitting until an acceptable ‘model’ of the molecules is reached.</p>
<p>In some cases, particularly when the origin of the unit cell is centro-symmetric, (has a centre of inversion) the structure factor is always real and the phase angle can only be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span> so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e^{i\varphi} =\pm 1\)</span>.</p>

<h3><strong>(100) reflexion</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#reflexion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this and the other reflexions we will calculate the structure factor by examining individual waves rather than plugging values into eqn. D4. Of course in practice the equation would always be used but it is useful to gain an insight into what the equation means.</p>
<p>The set of (100) planes is shown in the figure 100F by looking down the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> axis. The symmetry of the structure can be easily seen. The waves produced by the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{100}\)</span> are shown on the right. In this case the diffracted intensity is zero when summed over the two Ti and four oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>As shown in fig. 70, if an atom is at a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> from a plane it is at a fraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D/d_{hkl}\)</span> of the inter-planar distance with a phase of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi D/d_{hkl}\)</span> and contributes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{d_{hkl}}\cos(2\pi D/d_{hkl} )\)</span> to the total intensity where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{d_{hkl}}\)</span> is the atomic scattering factor for the atom at distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> with coordinate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({xyz}\)</span>, see fig. 77. When the phase is zero or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( 2\pi\)</span> then the cosine is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos(0)=\cos(2\pi) = 1\)</span>. Similarly if the phase difference is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi/2\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(90^\text{0}\)</span> the phase is zero; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos(\pi/2)=0\)</span>. The opposite is the case for phase based on sine waves but as the TiO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> has a centre of symmetry at the origin, the sine terms always add up to zero and need not be calculated.</p>
<p>Looking down the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> axis in fig. 80, i.e. showing the edges of the (110) planes, seen as horizontal lines, produces fig. 81; the Ti<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> ion is at half the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{100}\)</span> distance and so has phase <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos(2\pi/2)=-1\)</span> where as the Ti<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_1\)</span> ion is at zero and so has phase(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos(0)=+1\)</span> so the waves from each of these ions are completely out of phase and so add to zero. Similarly the oxygen atoms <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\)</span> are separated by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D=d_{100}/2\)</span> so are also completely out of phase with one another and for the same reason so are O atoms <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\)</span>. Thus each atom is paired with another similar one exactly out of phase with it and diffraction from the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((100)\)</span> plane is expected to have a   structure factor of zero; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{100}=0\)</span> as is confirmed by experiment.</p>

<p>Although the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((200)\)</span> planes are parallel to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((100)\)</span> the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((200)\)</span> reflection is not zero. This can be seen in fig. 82, and is because the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{200}\)</span> is half that of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{100}\)</span>. This means that Ti<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_1\)</span> and Ti<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> are now in phase with one another as each is on a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((200)\)</span> plane and therefore each has zero phase. The phase contribution from the Ti ions is therefore <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2f^{Ti}_{d_{200}}\cos(0)=2f^{Ti}_{d_{200}}\cos(0) = 16.02\)</span> where the number is the value of the atomic scattering factor at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/2d_{200}=0.214\)</span>. Pairs of oxygen atoms are in the same relative symmetry, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 : 3\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 : 4\)</span> so only the phase of O<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> and O<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_3\)</span> need be calculated.  Oxygen 2 is at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y/b=0.8025\)</span> so the structure factor is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^O_{d_{200}}\cos( 2\pi h 0.8025)= -4.76\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k=l=0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x/a=0.8025\)</span>.

<h3><strong>(110) reflexion</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The (110) reflection is strong, fig. 83. All the Ti atoms are in the (110) plane and so their phase is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi\)</span> thus the cosine is unity and the amplitude of each is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f^{Ti}_{d_{110}}=16.95\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/2d_{110}= 0.152\)</span>. Oxygens <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span> are also in the plane and their phase is similarly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi\)</span> thus each amplitude is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f^O_{d_{110}}=6.96\)</span>. The other oxygens are at fractional distances of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{110}\)</span>. Oxygen 3 is at a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D_{O3}=2.003\)</span> which is a phase angle of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi 2.003/4.65\equiv 219^\text{o}\)</span> with amplitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f^O_{d_{110}}\cos(2\pi 0.43)=-5.39\)</span>. The fourth oxygen also has a phase angle of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-219^\text{o}\)</span> but adds towards the total because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos(-\theta)=\cos(\theta)\)</span>. From all 6 atoms in the unit cell the total structure factor is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{110}=37\)</span> so the intensity is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1369\)</span> and should be seen as an intensely bright spot.</p>

<p>Having obtained structure factors we can attempt to find the position of the atoms. All that has to be done is to use eqns D3 with D5. Of course we already know the answer but let us check that we can reproduce the positions of the atoms of fig 81 for example, and by looking down the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> axis calculate the projection of the structure onto the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a-b\)</span> plane.  Figure 84 shows the result where the centroid of the contours are in the same relative positions as the original, fig 81. The most intense features arise from the Ti atoms as they contain most electrons. This figure was calculated by dividing the unit cell into a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(40 \times 40\times 40\)</span> grid and summing along the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> axis. Only <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span> values from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-5 \to +5\)</span> were used showing that a reasonable reproduction of the structure is possible using a relatively limited range of. Using a larger range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hkl\)</span> reduces the spot sizes as smaller <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_{hkl}\)</span> are used and so the resolution increases.</p>

<p>Figure 84. The calculated projection onto the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a-b\)</span> plane, i.e. looking down the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span>-axis. The unit cell is outlined and a few extra atoms are also shown. The Ti scatter with the greater intensity than the oxygen. The maximum contour is limited and consequently the Ti atoms are white at their most intense position. This calculated projection structure is the same as in fig 80 and 81.</p>

An <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> value of less that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx 0.2\)</span> may be acceptable as an initial fit, but half this value or better is expected for a refined fit to the data. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> factor between the two structures, fig. 85, is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.26\)</span> showing that the agreement between them is poor as is clear from the images of the projections. The bond lengths Ti to oxygen 1 (or 2) is only changed by 0.023 nm in a bond length of 0.20 nm and this shows how sensitive x-ray diffraction is to small changes in geometry. The bond length Ti to oxygen 3 (or 4) is similar to that for the other two oxygens and is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.196\)</span> nm but looks less because of the projection down the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> axis.</p>

<h2>13.10 Xray Diffraction from DNA<a class="headerlink" href="#xray-diffraction-from-dna" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Figure 85a is a copy of the original figure from Rosalind Frankin and R. Gosling’s 1953 paper (Nature, v.171, p.740, 1953) which showed for the first time the x-ray diffraction pattern from para-crystalline, calf thymus B-DNA fibres. In the same issue is the famous paper by Watson and Crick (Nature v.171, p.737, 1953) in which they speculate, with a sketch of the same, that the DNA is a double helix with base pairs inside the helices and the phosphates on the outside. They comment ‘we have been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins and Dr. R. E. Franklin’ which brings us back to figure 85a. Three quarters of a century later, the quality of this image looks poor but recall that this was recorded on photographic plates and that transistors, and thus integrated circuits, had not been invented and neither had electronic detectors, such as ccd’s, and computers were all but unknown. The fact that sensitivity was low by modern standards means that the only spots (‘blobs’) detected come from atoms with the most electrons which are the phosphorous atoms, or possibly the phosphate group, and knowing this greatly helps identification.  Naturally far better x-ray data was soon available but it is very interesting to see how the limited original data lead to a correct understanding of the structure.</p>
<p>The image contains a great deal of information that is accessible without any detailed calculation. The X or cross shape on the overall image is clear as are the split horizontal lines. The generally broad size of each ‘blob’ is due to the fact that the sample was para-crystalline, i.e. it was pulled out of a viscous aqueous solution of the sodium salt. The DNA filaments are kept apart by the water and counterions (Na<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^+\)</span>) and in this state the DNA is kept more or less parallel along the fibre pulling direction but randomly distributed otherwise, probably rather like a nematic liquid crystal. This disorder also means that the spot sizes (‘blobs’ or ‘smears’) are large.</p>
<p>The cross or x-shape indicated that the structure is a helix such as produced from a straight linear polymer. The structure factor for helices producing this unique signature has previously been worked out by Cochran et al. (1952), so that it must have been obvious on seeing the x-ray image that a helix was present. This form of an image is only observed because the x-ray is at right angles to the fibre pulling direction, and so the DNA helices are seen side on. Had this not been the case and the DNA’s were aligned in the same direction as the x-ray (sideways to pulling direction) then an image similar to that of fig 63 (bottom row) would have been formed but with twenty fold symmetry.</p>
<p>The horizontal lines, called ‘layer lines’, labelled in fig 85a from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm 10\)</span>, are the result of the helix not being continuous but due to phosphate groups in parallel layers along the twist of the helix. Just as in fig. 65 where two spheres cause the image to be split with fringes, so in the DNA the vertical splitting of the x-ray image (the ‘layer lines’) is due to interference between the helical twist of the phosphates’ positions and the planes containing individual pairs of phosphate groups. The structure is shown on the right of fig 85a where the circles represent the phosphates; the red and blue lines are only to guide the eye. Although it is not very clear from the x-ray image this does repeat after <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\)</span> layer lines are encountered. This is shown as the approximately diamond shape from the two dark regions top and bottom and the fuzzy, but clear, features on the left and right with maxima at the zero’th layer line. This shows that there are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\)</span> phosphates in a period and from the dimensions of the image the period is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.4\)</span> nm with each base pair separated by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.34\)</span> nm and the helix thus has a twist of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(36^\text{o}\)</span>. Note how the period in the helix and in the x-ray image are in a reciprocal relationship as are conjugate variables in any fourier transform.  The position of the maximum intensity of a layer line, i.e. the angle it makes to the vertical is used to calculate the radius of the helix, which turns out to be almost exactly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> nm.</p>
<p>The image shows that the 4th layer line is missing, this is a crucial observation and can only be explained by there being two similar helices separated by 3/8 of a period. The interference of these two helices produces a very precise pattern. Different periods, for example, produce different patterns of missing and weak and strong layer lines. A more detailed analysis has been given by  Lucas et al. (1999), Crouse (2007) and Thompson et al. (2018).</p>

<p>Figure 85a. Modified X-ray fibre image of B-DNA, ‘photograph 51’. The original image is given by R. Franklin &amp; R. Gosling, Nature, 1953, v.171, p.170. The period was measured as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p=3.4\)</span> nm. The radius of the helix is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> nm. The vertical line on the right hand diagram shows the centre of the helix. The circles the phosphate groups, the dashed lines the position of the base pairs. The red and blue helices  are just to guide the eye. Note the reciprocal relationship between the dimensions on the image and on the structure. The two helices are displaced by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3p/8\)</span> and this is determined by the absence of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4^{th}\)</span> layer line.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The pattern of the layer lines can be understood from basic wave theory, an example is given in Chapter 1, section 5.5 or by using figure 85b below. When the phase between the two helices differs (A and B) by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((3/8)2\pi n \equiv 3n\lambda /8\)</span> only the fourth order line has zero intensity, because the waves are out of phase by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\lambda/2\)</span> and so exactly cancel one another. Cancellation can happen with other phases but then other layer lines do not fit the experimental data, for example <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/8\)</span> predicts a more intense first than second layer line which is not observed.</p>
<p><img alt="Drawing" src="../_images/fourier-fig85b.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 85b. When the phase is different by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((3/8)2\pi n \equiv 3n\lambda /8\)</span> the fourth order line (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=4\)</span>) has zero intensity, because the waves A and B are out of phase by an integer number of half wavelengths (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\lambda/2\)</span>) and so cancel one another.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>As a test the x-ray image can be simulated by positioning the phosphate groups in helices as shown on the right of fig. 85a, and for simplicity in two dimensions, and then fourier transforming this image. This of course is a considerable approximation but if the diffraction pattern is calculated at small angles the approximation is fairly good. A bigger approximation is that only a single molecule is included, whereas in the experiment many tens of thousands will diffract the x-rays. If a second or third structure is added to our simulation then each of the ‘blobs’ is divided by fringes, just as in figures 65 to 69. The fact that the simulation and data are similar means that in the experiment disorder in position and angular arrangement is making the many separate spots that would be present in a perfect crystal merge into blobs.</p>
<p>A simulated result is shown in figure 85c where the scattered peaks are shown as contours, red being the most intense and blue the least. The white areas have too little scattering and are below the threshold set to make a clear image. The connection with the experimental x-ray image is clear. Note that layer line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\)</span> is missing and layer line 1 is less intense than line 2.</p>
